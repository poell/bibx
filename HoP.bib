Abstract = {This article examines the stereo daguerreotypes produced by the
   England-based photographer Antoine Claudet, beginning in 1842 and
   continuing through the 1860s. An argument is made for the importance of
   these photographs, because of the technical innovations they represent
   but also due to their conceptual sophistication. In many of these works,
   Claudet turned looking at photographic images into a self-reflexive
   activity, into an activity overtly dependent on a productive interaction
   of eye and photograph.},

Abstract = {This article is concerned with photographic images and identity
   photographs utilised for military counterinsurgent policing in Guatemala
   City during the civil war (1960-96), in the context of Latin America's
   Cold War. The article explores the historical conditions that made
   militarised policing and its photographic record possible in Guatemala,
   focusing on a dossier produced in the early 1980s known as Diario
   Militar. The article pays attention to aesthetic and evidentiary regimes
   that rely on the indexical force of photographs under circumstances in
   which indexicality fails. In doing so, it elaborates on
   counterrevolutionary policing as a way of seeing and not being seen,
   producing photographic images that at once identify political subjects
   and attempt to disappear their identities, and how these photographic
   imaginaries are being re-signified in contemporary struggles for justice
   in postwar Guatemala.},

Abstract = {This article explores the intersection between policing and photography
   in the course of the Civil Disobedience Movement in colonial Bombay in
   1930-31 by focusing on historical photographs compiled in a recently
   discovered album. When the `disobedient' men, women and children of
   Bombay repeatedly challenged the colonial state by breaking laws deemed
   unjust under the leadership of Mohandas K. Gandhi, they came into direct
   confrontation with the most visible expression of imperial authority:
   the cross-racial Bombay Police armed with the ubiquitous baton (lathi).
   While Indian historiography is particularly rich in its exploration of
   both exceptional and quotidian forms of colonial violence, the visual
   history of violent policing remains underexplored. Through our analysis
   of photographic images from two specific episodes of the disobedient
   drama that unfolded in Bombay in 1930 - the raids at the salt pans in
   Wadala in June, and the national flag salutation ceremony at the
   Esplanade in October - we explore the complex and conspicuous
   entanglement of race and gender in a moment of heightened anti-colonial
   action and police violence in British India. In underscoring the work of
   the camera in documenting the history of violent police action against
   non-violent civil demonstrators, we reveal its role as a historical
   actor and an active participant in history-making.},

Abstract = {This article investigates the first decade and a half of photographic
   practice in the Australian colonies from the perspective of family
   participation in the portrait marketplace. The article argues that this
   period has largely been narrated around determining the point of
   photography's arrival. This approach risks underplaying both the
   significant innovation and entrepreneurship that defined early
   photographic practice in this part of the British Empire and how
   photographic culture engaged with settlers' dispossession of First
   Nations land. This is not to say that early colonial Australian
   photography developed in isolation. Rather, the evasion of early British
   photography patents, as well as Australia's geographic location diluted
   the perpetuation of the English studio model in this part of the world.
   This, in turn, impacted the kinds of individuals who practised as
   daguerreian photographers in the colonies and - because of the appetites
   of colonial society, particularly settler families - the types of
   photographic products offered.},

Abstract = {Several large-scale photographic exhibitions featuring substantial
   participation from the USSR were organised in Czechoslovakia in the
   1930s. Despite the number of local and foreign actors they involved, and
   the critical response they triggered, they have raised limited scholarly
   interest so far. To shed light on the conditions under which these
   events were planned and realised, it is necessary to turn to exhibition
   catalogues, archives of the organisers and press reviews. Based on this
   data set, this article questions the part these displays played in
   propagating Soviet photographic discourses and aesthetic models in
   Czechoslovakia. New evidence from the archives of the Soviet All-Union
   Society for Cultural Ties Abroad (Vsesojuznoe obscestvo kul'turnoj
   svjazi s zagranicej {[}VOKS]) suggests that the Marxist critic Lubomir
   Linhart was the most committed mediator of Soviet photography and
   promoter of its documentary and utilitarian approach. By orchestrating
   the Soviet participation in the two exhibitions of social photography in
   1933 and 1934, the International Exhibition of Photography in 1936 and
   in several unrealised projects, Linhart and other supporters of the USSR
   had succeeded, by the late 1930s, in asserting the photographer's social
   function in Czechoslovakia, in close relation to the Soviet discourse on
   functional and politically committed photography.},

Abstract = {Although very short-lived, the Colorsnap process, promoted in 1928-29 by
   the small British company Colour Snapshots (1928) Ltd, is mentioned in
   several histories of colour photography processes as a key example of a
   false start in colour photography. Such accounts emphasise problems with
   technical quality and poor industrial organisation, but miss the key
   role of the market in patents and changes in investment practices in the
   period. From 1926 to 1929, the London Stock Exchange saw a frenzy of
   speculative investment in companies touting new innovations in media,
   linked to gramophone, radio, cinema, photography and photo-telegraphy.
   Like most of these companies, Colour Snapshots was inexperienced and
   completely dependent on the success of an untested patent. The company
   promoter deployed the then-common strategy of underpricing, consequently
   the company was undercapitalised and unable to finance production.
   Colour Snapshots was liquidated in the Great Slump of 1929-33. This
   article situates it in wider cultures of the market, in cultural
   practices of invention, and ideologies of modernity and innovation. It
   argues that the rise and fall of Colorsnap expresses the opportunistic
   practices of invention and speculative finance of the time.},

Abstract = {A single glass plate negative formerly in the collection of Howard
   Carter (most famously the excavator of Tutankhamun's tomb) and now in
   the archives of the Griffith Institute, Oxford University raises a
   number of questions about photography, archaeological practice, and the
   creation and use of excavation archives. By following this negative,
   known as Negative VIII, on five of its trajectories through time, media,
   and space, I argue that the reproducibility of the photographic image
   creates a distinct set of issues within archaeology, which has preferred
   to emphasise photography as a unique record of the destructive
   excavation process. Tracing the genealogy of a photographic image
   (rather than the biography of a singular photograph) allows us to
   consider the circulation of photographs as physical objects and through
   public dissemination, as well as the relationship between an image's
   content and its use. The parallel existences of Negative VIII highlight
   the pitfalls and potentials of archival research, where - unless
   adequately recognised - the apparent banality of certain photographs,
   and their replication in multiple forms, may stubbornly confound
   attempts to deconstruct and decolonise the knowledge formations on which
   nineteenth-century Egyptology was built.},

Abstract = {US feminist grassroots organising of the 1960s positioned its critique
   of domestic violence within a social analysis of class, race, sexuality
   and gender. In subsequent decades, feminist organising largely shifted
   to service provision which brought collusion with state entities and
   police in the quest to criminalise domestic violence. Criminalisation
   introduced a demand for corroborative evidence including the use of
   photographs to `prove' violence as enacted on victims' bodies. Through a
   consideration of the history of domestic violence photography and
   ethnographic data gathered with women residing in a domestic violence
   shelter, I explore how domestic violence photographs can reinforce
   entrenched gendered and racialised inequities and engender new ones. In
   many states, evidence-based prosecution does not rely on victim
   testimony and can be used without the consent of the harmed person.
   Rather than simply a mechanism of state control, however, the meaning
   and utility of evidentiary photographs remain unstable. Ethnographic
   data suggest that photographs and videos of domestic violence
   reverberate within and beyond the logics of state violence. I argue that
   photographic consent emerges as a vector to consider alternatives to
   criminal prosecution via policing.},

Abstract = {Focusing on the output of Elizabeth Howe Bliss, a Progressive Era
   travelling social worker, this article explores the snapshots Bliss made
   in New York City, Oklahoma and France. Although circulated in her own
   time, Bliss's images and their publication history have only recently
   been rediscovered. They deserve further analysis as they illuminate the
   practices of women using photography personally and professionally
   during the early decades of the twentieth century, and for their value
   to researchers of photographic history and beyond. This article argues
   for the importance of recirculating Bliss's snapshots - as well as other
   forms of vernacular imagery - through the digital dissemination made
   possible by platforming these photographic materials online within
   virtual spaces, and considers the specifics of one such platform, the
   Smithsonian Learning Lab.},

Abstract = {Paper photography and paper money share a common history, especially in
   the context of the USA in the 1860s, a commonality explored by this
   article. The interconnection of the two media was first addressed by
   Oliver Wendell Holmes's metaphorical description of cartes de visite as
   `sentimental ``green-backs{''} of civilization'. This article focuses on
   Abraham Lincoln's public image as presidential candidate, one that was
   heavily influenced by the new craze for cartes de visite. At the same
   time, the advent of modern paper money as we know it is marked by the
   introduction of Demand Notes or so-called greenbacks, of which the
   ten-dollar denomination showed Lincoln's portrait after a photograph.
   Medial intersections between paper money and photography are taken into
   consideration in more theoretical terms, before a concluding section
   sets out the wider context of photography's involvement in the emergence
   and early turbulences of early national paper currencies in the Civil
   War era.},

Abstract = {Thilly Weissenborn (1883-1964) was one of Indonesia's first woman
   photographers of significance. She was born in Java but schooled, like
   most Netherlands colonials, in The Hague. At the age of eighteen, Thilly
   returned to Java where she trained in the famous Atelier Kurkdjian
   before opening her own studio in the province of Preanger. For more than
   two decades, she supplied the colonial government's tourist bureau with
   photographs featuring Java's exotic-looking scenery and Balinese temples
   and dancers. She also supplied Dutch dignitaries, colonial officials and
   wealthy Dutch families with souvenir albums featuring scenic photographs
   and Bali's governors and royalty. I argue that although her growing
   obsession with light was a feature shared by many contemporary American
   photographers, her photographs differed from theirs by dint of their
   connection to Netherlands colonialism. I further argue that this is most
   evident in their focus on the beauty of the landscape and the seeming
   tranquillity of life under colonial rule, but also their strong
   allusions to the Mooi Indie style of paintings popular among Dutch
   settlers. In the twenty-year period leading up to Japan's invasion of
   Indonesia, Weissenborn's images were widely sought after and reproduced
   by the Dutch East Indies Tourist Bureau; however, their strong
   connection to Netherlands colonialism means that they are today not just
   regarded ambivalently by photographic historians, but are frequently
   overlooked.},

Volume = {43},

Abstract = {This article explores the importance of portrait photography to the
   wartime collaborationist regime of Wang Jingwei, which governed parts of
   Japanese-occupied China from 1940 to 1945. The article demonstrates how,
   for a combination of practical, political, and cultural reasons, studio
   portraiture was chosen as one of the primary forms of media for the
   propagation of iconography by this administration. Studio portraiture
   was also, however, a realm in which this Chinese regime sought to stamp
   its own mark on visual culture, separate from the iconography of the
   occupying Japanese. The article demonstrates this by tracing the origins
   and fate of a number of widely circulated studio portraits of Wang taken
   in 1939, 1940, and 1941. This article also speculates about the
   possibility of identifying and defining an ?occupied lens? during the
   war, one which was clearly derivative of prewar forms yet evolved in
   ways which set it apart both from Japanese propaganda and from the
   visual culture of resistance.},

Abstract = {This article explores the intellectual underpinnings of the late-1960s
   Japanese photography collective Provoke. It argues that Provoke was more
   radical and theoretically inflected than is conventionally understood,
   its project being the forging of a scientific' photography capable of
   unveiling the untruth' of established relations of power and knowledge
   production in Japan. I present Provoke's central figure to be Taki Kji,
   who in 1967-68 published a series of articles that introduced
   structuralism into Japanese image discourse and established the basis
   for Provoke's theoretically informed practice, or praxis. The article
   outlines how, in response to a variety of influences (Roland Barthes,
   Matsumoto Toshio, and Kevin Lynch, among others, but apparently not
   Antonio Gramsci or Louis Althusser), Taki formulated the notion of a
   unified and self-regulating ideological environment' (kanky) that is
   made manifest in a variety of seemingly neutral and benign cultural
   forms. Additionally, he theorised a semiotically transgressive
   photographic image, derived from Barthes's early studies of photography,
   which he believed could escape language and code - and thereby the
   ideological superstructure. I conclude by showing that Taki's
   emancipatory project, while singular in relation to contemporaneous
   Marxist oppositional endeavours in Europe, was ultimately
   self-defeating: the efforts of Provoke's photographers to strip their
   images of readable codes by deliberately mishandling' their cameras only
   worked to create new ones, and the shakiness and blurriness of the
   resulting photographs became a mere style.},

Abstract = {Official Australian photography of the military occupation of postwar
   Japan provides a significant modern case study of photography as a
   medium of neo-colonial and Orientalist representation. Asserting its
   dominance of the combined British Commonwealth Occupation Force
   supporting the Americans, the Australian military revelled in the role
   of occupier of a wartime enemy who was still widely loathed. Sometimes
   compared with the British Raj in Imperial India, the Occupation became a
   historically familiar exercise of the white man's power and privilege
   over the conquered and colonised Asiatic. It was marked by the rituals
   and practices of tourism, including the taking of photographic images.
   Photography was the main medium by which the event was recorded and
   circulated to the public back in Australia. Keen to convey images of a
   force enjoying the privileges of victory while in firm control of a
   still distrusted people, official photographers affiliated with the
   Australian military sought to capture a picturesque, feminised and
   ``traditional' Japan. This was a Japan that the war had made obsolete
   and which the Occupation was intended to modernise. The photographic
   appropriation of Japan reveals the ambiguity of the Occupation project,
   and the shallowness of Orientalist representation more generally.},

Abstract = {In the 1860s, the debate over whether photography was an accurate and
   useful tool for recording microscopic specimens was unresolved. Albert
   Moitessier's La photographie appliquee aux recherches micrographiques
   (1866) was one of the first instructional books to outline techniques
   combining photography and microscopy. Moitessier was unique among his
   contemporaries in his emphasis on stereoscopy and binocular vision. This
   essay addresses questions arising from Moitessier's unusual inclusion of
   a stereograph in his plates and his description of stereoscopic
   techniques in his text. While an ordinary photomicrograph renders the
   invisible microscopic world visible, the stereoscope brings this
   intangible realm within reach. The stereoscope is imbued, in this
   context, with a unique machinic vision as well as a haptic faculty that
   supersedes human perceptual ability. The apparent objectivity these
   extra-human capabilities facilitate, in turn, lends autonomy to
   stereo-photomicrographic tools. As the gulf between human and machine
   perception widens, the spectre of artificial intelligence grows,
   contributing to the disorientation in the nineteenth century over an
   expanded sense of existence.},

Abstract = {This article, examining the circulation of prints, letters and ideas in
   the context of Pictorialism, deals with an ambitious but long-forgotten
   federation, the International Society of Pictorial Photographers.
   Founded in 1905 but almost immediately abandoned, this utopian project
   to simplify the organisation of international exhibitions did not alter
   the future of pictorial photography as it was intended to do. Studying
   its origins, creation and rules, and revealing the causes of its
   failure, this article sheds light on the politics of Pictorialism and
   examines one of its most ambivalent characteristics, namely the defence
   of national interests within a movement relying mostly on international
   collaboration. It also shows the central role played by Robert Demachy
   (1859-1936) and Alfred Stieglitz (1864-1946) in the matter. Despite its
   disappointing outcome, this story is that of a remarkable exchange of
   opinions, through sustained correspondence and texts, dealing mainly
   with the circulation of prints, among members of a global photographic
   network.},

Abstract = {This article looks at Mexican photographer Graciela Iturbide's Cholos/as
   series taken on both sides of the border: in Los Angeles in 1986 and in
   Tijuana in 1989. The cholos/as, or gang members, have a complex
   relationship to Mexico; this response grows in part from the constructed
   nature of the border in general - a symbolic and relatively recent
   division between nations that does not represent lived reality or
   divisions between identities and cultures. As an outsider, Iturbide
   inserts visual cues throughout the series that tie the cholos/as'
   lifestyle to its Mexican roots and historical legacies, thus
   recuperating the mexicanidad, or Mexican identity, that exists in the
   borderlands. The narrative thrust of this series is strong,
   foregrounding female agency and matrilineal family structures over
   traditional, heteropatriarchal conceptions of family; complex
   negotiations of personal identity; and generally emphasising the social
   ties of border communities and subcultural groups through a distinct
   aesthetic style that intervenes in traditional photographic genres like
   studio portraiture. Iturbide's images form an origin story for the
   topicality of the US-Mexico border at the present moment and demonstrate
   that the issues of the border have been a critical point of inquiry for
   artists since the 1980s.},

Abstract = {Charles Marville's photographs of Paris preserve the look of streets
   slated for demolition under Georges-Eugene Haussmann. This article
   examines his photographs of the Carrieres d'Amerique, or America
   Quarries - gypsum quarries in the outlying Parisian neighbourhood of
   Belleville. At a time when the rezoning of districts that were formerly
   extra muros was still controversial, Belleville was seen as a
   crime-ridden area. Marville's photographs become documents that refute
   contemporary narratives of criminality. Borrowing Walter Benjamin's view
   that the city `opens up' to the flaneur `as a landscape', the article
   analyses Marville's landscapes of the Carrieres d'Amerique as images
   that juxtapose the city, the work site, and the no-man's land or
   terrains vagues at Paris's outer limits.},

Month = {APR 3},
Abstract = {In its first instance as art practice among the historical avant-garde,
   photomontage was considered indispensable for its claim to intervene in
   perceptual processes, stimulating a critical mode of apprehension that
   would redirect the viewer away from conventions of aesthetic experience
   and towards a lived reception of art with pronounced relevance to the
   sociopolitical landscape. The effect was understood as structural, that
   is, activated not so much by direct political content, but by the stark
   and shocking effects of juxtaposition. By this measure, one challenge to
   contemporary photomontage is clear: in a postindustrial and postdigital
   visual landscape dominated by the structural fragmentation of the
   attention economy, the `simultaneity of the radically disparate' (as
   Peter Burger put it) might no longer present as heterodoxy but rather
   threaten to sink into invisibility. Yet with the migration off-screen of
   the effects of electronic media, a new urgency around moving
   photomontage structures into physical, public space is rising in
   contemporary practices. Shannon Ebner's multi-part project A Hudson Yard
   (2014-15) is emblematic of the new ways in which artists are
   manipulating photomontage as a form of fully sensory experience that
   gives the medium room to play critically in both virtual and material
   space. By constructing subtle interruptions of naturalised commercial
   space, A Hudson Yard activates a detournement of instrumentalised
   language, using structures of juxtaposition to divert the discursive
   surfaces of public space away from consumption and towards what could be
   called a public poesis.},

   Photographer},
Journal = {HISTORY OF PHOTOGRAPHY},

Volume = {42},

Pages = {146-167},
Abstract = {Spirit photographs are joint portraits that visually unite the bereaved
   and the deceased without use of a corpse. Arising from the same ideas
   that founded Spiritualism in the nineteenth century, these enchanted
   mementos are said to have been discovered by William H. Mumler in 1861,
   in Boston, Massachusetts. Spirit photographers typically worked with
   mediums who enabled the appearance of magical extras' of the deceased,
   and as the majority of mediums were women, their contributions to this
   development within personal mourning rituals have been limited almost
   exclusively to this activity. Fuelled by the acknowledged proximity of
   two women to the invention, Helen F. Stuart and Hannah Frances Green,
   this article challenges Mumler's widely accepted status as the
   originator of spirit photography. Although Stuart was the owner of the
   studios where Mumler stumbled upon his invention and Green was a
   secretary and medium in the same studios, scholars have tended to refuse
   these women larger roles. This article establishes the viability of a
   new narrative, presenting the strong likelihood that these women were in
   fact one and the same person and proposing that this woman be recognised
   as a pioneer of spirit photography.},

Abstract = {The history of issues of privacy in relation to photography is generally
   dated to the introduction of handheld cameras and halftone printing at
   the end of the nineteenth century. Citing a remarkable series of
   notations in the records of famed Montreal photographer William Notman,
   this article argues that privacy concerns were at issue in the everyday
   operations of the photography studios that preceded amateur photography.
   These notations represent the rudimentary attempts that some of Notman's
   clients made to restrict the circulation, sale and availability of their
   studio portraits starting in the 1870s. This article speculates that the
   emergent anxieties regarding privacy exemplified by such notations were
   informed by the setup and marketing practices of early photography
   studios. Ultimately, this analysis seeks to show that current debates
   about privacy, photography and visibility can be traced back to the
   commercial systems that developed in tandem with early photography
   technologies.},

Abstract = {This article examines Afro-Brazilian photographer Januario Garcia's
   images of the favela Morro do Salgueiro in Rio de Janeiro, shot from
   late 1983 to early 1984. I argue that through his depictions of
   traditional family units, architectural details and children in front of
   Rio's cityscapes, Garcia made activist photography that showcased the
   favela as a humane and family-oriented place, in opposition to the
   government and white elite's historical denigration of such
   neighbourhoods - hilltop shantytowns with predominantly Black residents,
   often located next to wealthy neighbourhoods. Garcia positioned the
   favela's Afro-Brazilian residents as active contributors to the city's
   modern built environment, challenging previous associations of the Black
   figure with folkloric and rural spaces. In addition, his images openly
   display the favela's poverty - an indelible mark of Brazil's persistent
   racism - as a way to combat discrimination and assert Black
   consciousness in a country that sought to erase the presence of African
   heritage especially in centralised southeastern cities.},

Abstract = {A few years after opening their celebrated photography studio in their
   new home in Philadelphia, German immigrants William and Frederick
   Langenheim produced eight almost identical daguerreotype panoramas of
   Niagara Falls. Keeping one set for themselves, they sent the others to
   multiple heads of state. The brothers' identities as American
   photographers and experiences as German immigrants, this article
   demonstrates, shaped their specific photographic vision of the
   impressive cataracts as well as its circulation abroad. By calling
   attention to the German dimensions of this project, this article
   underscores their panorama as an important articulation of
   German-American identity formation. The article thus highlights the
   intercultural nature of the Langenheim brothers' photographic practice,
   and the fact that the medium itself was rooted in international networks
   and trade in the mid-nineteenth century. Through a close examination of
   their advertising campaigns, their relationship with optician Peter
   Wilhelm Friedrich von Voigtlander and their extraordinary 1845 panorama,
   this article allows us to better understand how ideas of culture were
   negotiated through the making and distribution of early photography.},

Abstract = {Conceptualising an alternative to the Rieglian analyses of the
   correlation between power and composition in group portraiture, this
   article proposes a ritualistic approach to understanding the group
   photograph and its commemorative purpose. The proposal is raised through
   a case study of the photograph of Tohoro Duanfang (1861-1911) and an
   assembly of scholarly officials with the altar bronzes in his
   collection. Despite the uncertainty about its date and location, the
   photograph has been widely published in books on Chinese ancient bronzes
   and the culture of collecting. This article dates, decodes and
   contextualises this image within the imperial tradition of reinstating
   ancient bronzes in Confucius worship. It also discusses photography's
   primacy in the late Qing antiquarian praxis of studying, cataloguing and
   displaying bronzes. This study demonstrates that the process of taking a
   group photograph consists of a composite ritualistic event in which a
   `pro-photographic' event is imbricated with a `photographic event'. This
   imbricated flow of event and ritual may shed light on understandings of
   group photographs with an intelligibility that is not only visual, but
   also temporal.},

Abstract = {Among the various new modes for making photographs that were explored by
   Australian photographers in the first decades of the twentieth century,
   three in particular - Pictorialist images, authentic records, and
   personal snapshots - had far-reaching implications for the institutions
   of Australian photography. Pictorialist photographs are now the
   foundation of many Australian art museum collections; photographic
   records produced at the time have become iconic in Australian public
   history, forming the backbone of many social history collections; and
   personal snapshots from the period are increasingly reproduced in social
   histories. Historians of Australian photography have discussed and
   analysed each of these modes(1), but they have tended to treat them
   separately, or even in opposition to each other, and to concentrate on
   the distinct careers of individual photographers. This article looks at
   this crucial period, and these key photographic modes, from the point of
   view of the worldwide networks and systems for the distribution,
   exhibition, collection, and indexing of photographs. We show how these
   modes, far from being distinct, overlapped one another as each grappled
   with the same issues of nation, history, and memory, and as each
   articulated their nationalistic concerns through international networks
   and idioms.},

Abstract = {In the mid 1880s a little-known photographer named Robert Harris
   produced a series of albumen prints showing the stages of body searching
   that black labourers in De Beers diamond mines were obliged to undergo
   by state ordinance enacted in 1883. The original photographs surfaced
   briefly in the saleroom in 2007 but have since disappeared. Two sets of
   copies survive. Bearing in mind the history of documentary photography
   in South Africa, this article examines the historical and textual
   significance of this series of photographs in the context of the history
   of mining and discusses the imperatives and ethics of locating,
   researching, and publishing controversial imagery in the Internet age.},

   (1866) as Alexander Gardner's manifesto on the possibilities of the

   story of the US Civil War could never be told, the Sketch Book suggests
   otherwise. Throughout the work, Gardner implicitly presented the
   photographic image as a form of relic, one that did not simultaneously
   destroy and disperse the site it portrayed. Its presentation of
   seemingly unmediated fact was intended to anchor the book's descriptions
   and imbue the writing with the imprimatur of truth. Presented as a
   natural emanation of war-rent sites, the photograph could allow for
   historical dissemination without decimation.},

Abstract = {This article explores the early introduction of photographic images to
   the daily newspaper in Korea in the second decade of the twentieth
   century. The technology of mass printing photographic images was
   pioneered by the Government General's Korean-language newspaper, Maeil
   sinbo, in the years immediately after Japan's colonial occupation began.
   The encounter between the two technologies of photography and printing
   thus developed within the broader context of colonial governmentality
   and the simultaneous emergence of modern structures of the archive and
   the individual. Exploration of the first published snapshot series
   offers a case study of the entanglement of modern technologies in the
   social relations of early photographic images. Reading the snapshot
   series today reveals the contours of a politics and aesthetics of
   colonial visuality, which was to long outlive the only apparently
   trivial series.},

Abstract = {This article describes the institutionalisation of Brazilian photography
   in the late 1970s and early 1980s in the context of the other events
   relating to photography in Latin American countries. This process has
   close links with the first two Latin American Colloquia of Photography
   held in Mexico City in 1978 and 1981. These Colloquia promoted the
   creation of connections between Brazilian photographers and photographic
   institutions and those in Spanish-speaking Latin America. They also made
   it possible to bring European and North American institutional
   photographic experiences to Latin America, and helped to disseminate a
   version of Latin American photography in Europe, one that was based on a
   socially engaged documentary, the genre which was showcased and
   foregrounded at the Colloquia.},

Abstract = {This article considers the daguerreotype and electricity as the key
   driving forces in the early histories of photography and photomechanical
   reproduction. Drawing on three examples - daguerreotype electrotypes,
   galvanically etched daguerreotypes and the etching process developed by
   Hippolyte Fizeau - the article aims to demonstrate how closely they were
   connected and how much interest they raised among scientists and
   photographers in the early 1840s, particularly in France, Britain and
   the German-speaking countries. The article shows in what ways the three
   processes were employed and who developed and used them, which
   institutions and learned societies were involved in their progress and
   which theoretical concepts and discussions they gave rise to. Although
   all three were only short-lived technologies and were largely forgotten
   by the end of the 1850s, they are more than mere curiosities, as they
   contribute significantly to our better understanding of the earliest
   histories of photography and photomechanical reproduction.},

Abstract = {The visual culture of the female nude in Western art, after decades of
   attention, possesses a considerable genealogy of critical scholarship.
   The photographic imagery of women's bodies occupies a significant place
   in this legacy, yet there are areas of inquiry that have to date
   remained little examined. In this article I consider a small and
   eccentric group of images, made by commercial photographers for popular
   consumption, posed by the American socialite Clara Ward around the turn
   of the twentieth century, as a case study of faux nudes - studio
   photographs in which models were encased in semitransparent body
   stockings, thus generalising, protecting and idealising the female body
   in its representation. If nudity is - ideally - an absolute state, it is
   nevertheless culturally complex in its various guises. The faux nudity
   constructed in these glamorous photographs was an invention of modern
   technology made possible by advances in commercial textile production as
   well as photography, as the stockinet body stocking provided a fiction
   of marmoreal whiteness further enhanced by being rendered in monochrome,
   and then widely distributed through cabinet prints and postcards. Around
   1900 such artefacts further mystified the woman's body in visual
   culture, producing a fantasy woman for modern times.},

Abstract = {Photographs of mid-Victorian cities evoke an unsettling perspective of
   modernity by calling attention to the spasmodic process of societal and
   environmental change in this period. Focusing on four diverse
   commissions undertaken by the professional photographer Thomas Annan in
   Glasgow in the latter half of the nineteenth century, this article
   explores intriguing exchanges between photography and other media in an
   enlarging Victorian print market. This material suggests that we have
   yet to fully appreciate the ways in which photography participated in
   the often-fraught public debate on urban space and civic identity in
   localised environments. The article also explores how recent
   interventions in digital humanities, particularly in the field of
   mapping technologies, have opened up new possibilities of animating and
   reexamining the remote, conventional and impersonal viewpoints that
   characterise photographic representations of metropolitan areas in this
   period.},

Abstract = {This article examines the photographic practices of the French Communist
   Party during the Third Period', when the Communist International adopted
   its most intransigent policies. Through an analysis of the magazines Nos
   Regards and Regards sur le monde du travail, I show that the Communists
   adopted a montage technique which expanded the practice from
   juxtapositions on the page to juxtapositions orchestrated across the
   whole publication. Photographs were thus used to articulate the conflict
   between opposed economic and political systems through sustained
   comparisons of capitalist countries and the fatherland of the
   International proletariat'. In the process, the magazines became
   collective works rather than miscellanies of individual articles,
   mounting a direct challenge to the practices of the bourgeois press.
   This challenge was also extended to the role of the press photographer,
   which the Communists proposed to supplant through the collaboration of
   worker photographers. Thus, the very work of photography was to be
   reimagined.},

Abstract = {A key dimension of photomontage is the way that its formal features -
   and consequent debates about the probity of making a photograph out of
   multiple sources - illuminate some of the fundamental problems of
   representation in the late nineteenth century. Among these was the
   question of whether an account of the past was properly presented as an
   unmediated transmission of fact, or demonstrably fashioned by an author:
   whether the tools of representation were to be submerged or emphasised.
   This article examines the parallels between the strategies of authorial
   visibility in early photomontage and the rhetorical approaches adopted
   by historians to modulate their presence in their texts. In particular,
   this study investigates the convergences of historiography and
   photomontage around the collapse of the Second Empire, a moment that
   witnessed powerful shifts in the conception of the voice of the
   historian as well as the production of photomontages that grappled with
   - and even thematised - the problem of their constructedness. An
   important but little-known group of photomontages by Eugene Appert,
   depicting the Imperial family in exile as well as the emerging Third
   Republic from which they fled, registers these conjunctions in their
   full complexity.},

Abstract = {Alois Riegl's Late Roman Art Industry has been one of the most
   influential books in the historiography of art and archaeology since its
   publication in Vienna in 1901. Riegl's treatise fundamentally altered
   the way Late Antique art was perceived and evaluated by historicising
   vision and theorising the relativity of aesthetic ideals. This article
   claims that Riegl's argument was originally made in images as well as in
   text, but that his visual rhetoric was lost when Otto Pacht edited Late
   Roman Art Industry for republication in 1927 and changed its
   illustrations. The article demonstrates that Pacht's pictorial
   amendments manifest the concerns of a new generation of formalist art
   historians, raising broader questions regarding the role of photography
   in art history's disciplinary codification. Restoring Riegl's visual
   argument, the article contends that Riegl used photography to visualise
   his innovative methodology and model a historically specific gaze.},

Abstract = {In 2020, the Baltimore Police Department used aerial surveillance camera
   technology, dubbed the `spy plane', that recorded the movements of
   nearly every citizen from above. Based on direct observation inside the
   programme's operations centre, this article shows how a `grainy truth'
   aesthetic, created by engineers to combat criticisms of the programme's
   invasiveness, also influenced the actual labour of surveillance. An
   obsession in the public debate and within the operations centre about
   how the imagery looks, however, overshadowed the most worrisome aspect
   of the programme: its infrastructure of representation. City officials
   are now saddled with managing a massive database of citizen location
   data owned by a private company, prompting difficult questions about the
   privatisation of policing.},

Abstract = {Far from being `over', photomontage has proliferated in our digital age,
   most commonly as meme. Although seemingly based on wit's lowest common
   denominator, memes illustrate the mass reach and cohesive function of
   the medium but also tell us something about the mood of the moment. It
   is the untapped potential of the medium that interests me here. Drawing
   on the anticipatory history of Marxist practitioners in the 1920s and
   1930s, including Walter Benjamin, Ernst Bloch, and John Heartfield, this
   article traces the coordinates of a potential radical practice that
   sparks discomfiture and cognitive reorientation. Rather than reproducing
   knowledge, photomontage can produce new forms of understanding; it can
   do so in complex and continually generative ways that remain
   underexplored in the digital age, in which an epistemology of suture
   predominates.},

Abstract = {`It is important to note that a photomontage need not necessarily be a
   montage of photos', the Constructivist writer Sergei Tretiakov declared
   in 1936. `No', he clarified; `It can be photo and text, photo and
   colour, photo and drawing'. In 2019, `photo and smartphone' might also
   appear in Tretiakov's list. The volatile image, filtered through
   applications and shared across shifting platforms, is far from a new
   phenomenon. Networks of photographic dissemination and manipulation,
   traceable to the medium's origins, have long precluded the possibility
   of a still photograph. As digital processes abstract cutting and pasting
   from scissors and glue, avant-garde photomontage offers a useful model
   with which to regard today's unprecedented fluidity of images.},

Abstract = {The Lima-born photographer Manuel Gonzalez Salazar documented the
   colonial architectural heritage of his native city, as well as other
   major Peruvian cities such as Cusco, Arequipa, Ayacucho, Cajamarca and
   Trujillo. Just as Eugene Atget had documented the old Paris that he saw
   gradually disappearing, Gonzalez Salazar chose to photograph the
   architectural and artistic heritage of the colonial era, which dominated
   the urban environment of the Peru of his day, but which was threatened
   by modernisation and social change. Like Atget in the French context,
   Gonzalez Salazar is an anomaly in the history of Peruvian
   twentieth-century photography, which is best known on the international
   stage for indigenismo and the depiction of pre-Hispanic customs. The
   rediscovery of Gonzalez Salazar's work invites scholars to pay greater
   attention to the cultural heritage of the colonial era, as well as to
   the archives that documented it in all its splendour.},

   Considering selections from Goldin's The Ballad of Sexual Dependency and
   Dijkstra's New Mothers photographs, this essay argues that instead of
   approaching the text critically through the lens of `voyeurism', this
   work is best explored by focusing on the question of `intimacy'. This
   essay situates the notion of intimacy both theoretically and
   historically, considering the workings of intimacy and its relationship
   to the persistence of inside/outside binaries (most frequently applied
   in discussion of the dynamics of the photographer/subject relationship).
   Looking at the way intimacy is represented through the surfaces of skin
   and the pregnant or maternal body, this essay speaks to questions of
   intention and critical reception and considers the ways in which
   photographers, subjects, and audiences engage with photographs as
   material objects.},

Abstract = {Dayanita Singh (b. 1961) has long pursued a practise of close
   relationships with her subjects, human and otherwise. In pairing this
   commitment with disseminating her photographs through book and portable
   museum formats, in which photographs are reused over the course of
   decades, she has developed a practice that she recognises as
   fundamentally archival. This article examines two distinct elements of
   Singh's oeuvre: Myself Mona Ahmed (2001), a book created with her friend
   Mona, a self-described `eunuch' cast out of her community in Delhi; and
   File Room, a constantly unfolding project appearing in multiple book and
   museum formats, focused on the materiality and temporality of the
   archive. I read both as part of Singh's `intimate archive', and
   understand this thread in her work as a feminist practise, one that
   extends to her invitation to viewers to engage with the book and museum
   objects, reworking these images into new intimate archives.},

Abstract = {This article examines a photographic album compiled by an Irish
   Republican Army unit during the Irish War of Independence, a guerrilla
   struggle fought in Ireland from 1919 to 1921 between the Irish
   Republican Army and the British Army, along with the quasi-military
   Royal Irish Constabulary. The employment of techniques and surveillance
   methods similar to those of the British state and police forces in
   Ireland enabled the group's intelligence squad to track the movements of
   their enemies. Those depicted were monitored and sometimes targeted for
   elimination, thus turning this photographic evidence against the state
   and its representatives. The article is based on witness statements,
   memoirs and parliamentary proceedings, thus revealing the importance of
   photography in the intelligence war against the British Empire. Studio
   portraits originally taken for familial or occupational uses, newspaper
   cuttings reflecting society events and covertly taken snapshots were
   triangulated with handwritten notes detailing the daily routines of
   those pictured. The album's multiplicity of formats constitutes a type
   of conflict photography that differs from the usual depictions of ruins
   and raids that dominated imagery of the Irish revolutionary period.},

Title = {`The Pictures Which We Publish To-Day Are Fearful to Look Upon': The
   Circulation of Images of Atrocity During the American Civil War},
Journal = {HISTORY OF PHOTOGRAPHY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {45},
Number = {1, SI},

Month = {JAN 2},
Abstract = {This article explores the circulation of photographs of prisoners of war
   that were taken at the US General Hospital in Annapolis, Maryland in
   1864. More specifically, it considers the publication of these images as
   wood engravings in Harper's Weekly's illustrated newspaper as part of a
   broader network of photographic circulation, and the circulation of
   images of atrocity during the American Civil War. This project follows
   recent interventions in photographic history that have emphasised
   reproduction and circulation, and that have decentred the photographic
   print as the primary site for the production of meaning. By examining
   the multiple visual and narrative contexts in which photographs of the
   Annapolis prisoners appeared, including as wood engravings in Harper's
   Weekly, this article reveals how divergent meanings were ascribed to the
   images, as both the press and the public sought to make sense of the
   prisoners' deterioration and to use their images for political purposes.
   Ultimately, the article employs circulation as a methodology to
   understand how audiences used photographs to make sense of the seemingly
   ineffable trauma and devastation of the American Civil War. This project
   also demonstrates how Harper's Weekly relied upon an existing public
   archive - of text and images, particularly cartes de visite - to report
   the news and to further its rhetorical position. It is important to
   highlight that the images in this article are disturbing. They show men
   in states of significant emaciation and were presumably taken without
   full consent. These pictures are shown as part of an effort to
   understand the ways in which images of atrocity were circulated in the
   nineteenth century, and, as such, requires that we consider the
   appropriateness of publishing and exhibiting such images both then and
   now. A question of care and of an ethics of looking must be at the
   forefront of this critical engagement.},

Abstract = {This essay offers a network theory of early photography of the Middle
   East. Drawing on Bruno Latour's elaboration of actor-network theory in
   Reassembling the Social (2005), it focuses on John Cramb's 1860
   photographs of Jerusalem, Maxime Du Camp's 1849-50 photographs of Egypt,
   and Auguste Salzmann's 1854 photographs of Jerusalem to critique art
   historical approaches that view these images solely in terms of their
   aesthetic values or documentary significance. What is slighted in such
   approaches, it argues, is the orientalist network that undergirds the
   works of these photographers. This essay discusses the overdetermined
   production of early photography of the Middle East to demonstrate that
   the large archive of early photographs of the region are inscribed
   within a complex web of actors, practices, institutions, as well as
   cultural, economic, and political relations between the West and the
   so-called `Orient', a network that provided the logistical means and the
   conceptual paradigms for the production and consumption of these images.},

Abstract = {This article examines a photographic archive that has been recently
   identified in the stores of the Uganda Broadcasting Corporation in
   Kampala. The archive consists of some eighty-five thousand black and
   white negatives that were taken by various official photographic units,
   government information officers and commercial photographers - all of
   whom worked under the umbrella of the Ministry of Information - most of
   them during the years of President Idi Amin's rule (1971-79).
   Significantly, the vast majority of these negatives appear never to have
   been used to make prints. As a result, their images have been literally
   never seen before. The archive significantly extends our understanding
   of official photography in Uganda, and in postcolonial Africa. In
   particular, it shows how infrastructures of administrative photography
   that were established during the colonial era, and which resulted in the
   medium becoming central to an imagined `exhibitionary complex',
   continued to hold into the 1970s. The archive also highlights how these
   same infrastructures became increasingly complicated during the Amin
   years, both as the regime became more invested in photography as a
   potential tool for increasing the `momentum' of its development agenda
   and as it became more reliant on other forms of mass media as a means
   for projecting its - increasingly imaginary - forms of governance to
   Uganda and to the world. Finally, however, the fact that the majority of
   the negatives were never printed suggests that whatever were the
   intended effects of official photographs in Amin's Uganda, in practice,
   the performance of photographic techniques and archiving may have been
   equally politically significant.},

Abstract = {This article examines the role of photography in the Year of Revolution
   and the place this topic holds in historiography. Unlike many historical
   disciplines which perceive 1848 as a turning point in the nineteenth
   century, the history of photography gives the impression that
   photographic production was not really affected by the upheavals which
   otherwise had a great impact on the whole of continental Europe.
   Collections and archives, however, contain large amounts of visual and
   written material that indicate the very opposite - that the involvement
   of photography in the events of 1848 was not rare. Using five examples
   from Central Europe, three portraits and two cityscapes, this article
   provides an insight into the cultural and historical backgrounds of
   photographic production in that year. The article demonstrates the ways
   in which photographs were involved in the social, political, and
   cultural events of the time, and how they helped shape ideas about them.},

Abstract = {Published posthumously, this article begins with a discussion of the
   historiography - and a related exhibition history - of the terms
   collage, photo-collage, and photomontage; and of the criteria that have
   been used to distinguish them as techniques, as visual idioms, and for
   their political implications and resonances as images of fine or applied
   art. The article then moves on to the work of two living artists who
   have been cutting and pasting photographs for more than forty years,
   Martha Rosler and John Stezaker, and the ambiguities of their being
   described as collagists, monteurs, or photomonteurs. In rethinking these
   categories, Evans argues for an expansive history of photomontage and
   collage that has continuing resonance today.},

Abstract = {Taking its point of departure from the current digitisation of the
   Harvard Astronomical Plate Collection, this article follows the plates
   back to the time when the status of photography as a research tool for
   astronomers was still to be established. It focuses on Charles S.
   Peirce, who, while employed by the US Coast Survey, made astronomical
   observations and contributed to the deliberation over visual and
   photographic methods. Particular attention is paid to Peirce's
   involvement in early explorations of photography's potential as a
   measurement tool. The guiding assumption is that approaching photography
   as a tool, rather than as a sign or representation, offers new inroads
   into the old problem of photography's revealing powers and its capacity
   to serve as a means of discovery in science. Drawing on Peirce's
   scientific practice as an alternative resource for theory construction,
   this article contributes to the ongoing efforts to conceptualise the
   productive or generative dimension of photographic methods. It concludes
   by pointing to the diagrammatic notion of evidence developed late in
   Peirce's philosophical career, proposing that photography be reconceived
   as a diagrammatic tool.},

   Emergency-era Malaya},
Journal = {HISTORY OF PHOTOGRAPHY},

Abstract = {This article explores the ways in which photography was used by the
   colonial state in Malaya to promote the supposed success of resettlement
   - the counterinsurgency scheme through which around half a million
   people were forcibly moved into camps, later renamed `New Villages',
   during the Malayan Emergency (1948-60). While this study engages with
   the ways in which the racialised category of the `squatter' - that is,
   rural Chinese who were the main object of resettlement - was reflected
   in official photography, it also argues for the need to consider such
   photography within broader developments in photographic practice and
   consumption in Southeast Asia during the early 1950s. These include the
   role of local Malayan photographers as part of the state propaganda
   apparatus and the emergence of Humanist photojournalism as a mode of
   expression in the same period. In doing this, the article suggests that
   the interaction between colonial photography and commercial
   photojournalism in Malaya complicates the extant literature on the
   `colonial gaze' while contributing to an emerging body of research on
   the tensions between colonialism and Humanism in early postwar
   photography.},

Abstract = {In this article, we animate the interstitial practices shared by
   photojournalists and police officers, and sketch some of the stakes for
   visual practitioners `bearing witness while black'. We employ visual
   analyses of protest images by Black photographers while tracing the
   specific visual techniques of oversight mobilised by law enforcement.
   These include police departments' co-optation of news images to identify
   and criminalise racial justice protesters alongside efforts to
   professionalise police officers into photographers. We theorise the
   anti-Black intersections shared across these expansive formations -
   policing and photojournalism - in an effort to account for the ways in
   which both systems maintain and invest in damaging visualities that
   shape consequences `on the ground' for Black and brown communities.},

Abstract = {This article examines prisoner photography in Qajar Iran encompassing
   images not only of criminals but also of religious apostates and
   political opponents, taken in an institutional framework between the
   1860s and the 1910s. The article sheds light on the use of photography
   as a technology of violence by the Qajar autocracy in the late
   nineteenth century and its use as a technology of evidence following the
   police reforms in the early twentieth century. Frequently used prior to
   imminent execution, photographs of prisoners became a ritual within the
   violent regime: a performative act associated with death and dying.
   Thus, prisoner photography correlated with the earlier body-centred
   forms of chastisement and torture in Qajar society that were abounded
   from the public spaces after several penal reforms. It was only in the
   wake of the broad-reaching police reforms in the 1910s that a universal
   system of judicial photography as instructed by Alphonse Bertillon was
   established, epitomising the ostensive aspects of the global mobility
   and circulation of technologies, methods and expertise. Thus, the
   practice of photographing prisoners lays bare unique insights into the
   judicial and penal systems of Qajar Iran and their ensuing
   transformation as part of modernisation and the formation of
   nation-building.},

Volume = {45},

Abstract = {This article examines the association between Wirephotos - the brand
   name that became a generic term for news photographs sent by telegraph,
   telephone or radio, also sometimes described as radiophotos - and
   objectivity. It suggests that many wirephotos functioned by making
   visible not places or events, but the drama of communication, understood
   as the challenging process of articulating messages across space and
   time. The article also considers Edward Steichen's use of Associated
   Press photographer Max Desfor's wirephotos in the exhibition Korea - The
   Impact of War, at the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 1951. It
   thinks through Steichen's use of the metaphor of `bridging' to describe
   the work of press photography and asks what it can tell us about
   photographic circulation and communication, particularly in
   mid-twentieth-century USA. By playing on the repertoire of meanings
   associated with bridges, Desfor's Flight of Refugees Across Wrecked
   Bridge in Korea can be read as reflecting on its own medium's
   limitations. As it circulated and recirculated in different formats,
   Desfor's bridge photograph dramatised communication's difficulty, and
   the always-present potential of failure in press photography's effort to
   bridge distance.},

Abstract = {What role should photographic evidence play in current debates about

   empire? This article examines the photographs that emerged from the
   Amritsar Massacre of 13 April 1919, considering what such documents can
   tell us about the relationship between atrocity and the imperial
   project. Colonials working in both official and unofficial capacities
   turned to photography in their attempt to justify this bloody
   twentieth-century episode. Such photography addressed colonial debates
   concerning the scope of moral and legal, individual and collective, and
   British and Indian culpability for the Massacre. It is therefore
   important that we attend to such visual evidence at the Massacre's
   centenary, as the United Kingdom is urged to apologise for the infamous
   slaughter of Indian men, women, and children.},

Abstract = {An optogram is an image fixed on the retina by a biological,
   photochemical process. In the late nineteenth century, it was widely
   believed that optograms could be excised from dead bodies to procure
   their final visions. Optograms were most frequently compared to
   photographs, so that the retina of the eye was likened to the sensitive
   plate in a camera. Just as photography became capable of superseding
   human vision in the 1870s, optograms discursively came to light as
   latent photographs, making photography the original for preconscious
   sight. These historical inversions of primacy challenge our conceptions
   of the relation between nature and culture in photography, with the
   cultural invention preceding the natural discovery of optography. This
   article examines how an incidental, speculative, and ultimately
   forgotten discovery in the physical sciences was deployed rhetorically
   to reinforce personal or disciplinary beliefs about what photography was
   and what it could do, in realms ranging from physiological laboratories
   to science fiction, from police departments to courtrooms. Analysis of
   optographic discourse indicates that the true value of photography in
   the late nineteenth century was not primarily in the photograph's
   relation to its indexical referent, but in the possibility that it might
   grant access to seeing as another living being.},

Abstract = {The intertwined development of popular photography and cycling in
   Britain was felt so close that, in the 1880s, contemporary commentators
   could write of cyclo-photographers'. The camera apparatus available at
   this time, bulky and fragile, was largely impractical to carry on a
   ride, and thus cyclo-photographers joined outdoor photographers in
   asking manufacturers for simpler and easier to operate cameras. However,
   a close reading of primary sources reveals that such demands were also
   the result of a new engagement with the possibility of seeing enabled by
   cycling itself. What was the cyclo-photographers' experience of visual
   modernity? This article explores whether, and in what ways, the parallel
   emergence of a desire for compact cameras was linked to the new, and
   interconnected, ways of moving and seeing that the engagement with these
   two modern cultural technologies had made possible.},

Abstract = {Richard Daintree is well known as an Australian colonial photographer
   and geologist. I look at six international exhibitions he created from
   1872 to 1879 that promoted the colony of Queensland by systematically
   integrating spectacular grids of painted photographs with displays of
   scientific samples. By analysing installation views, I argue that the
   popular success of these exhibitions came from the use of various new
   photographic technologies within the space of the exhibition, where the
   frontier directly interacted with the metropole. Further, I argue that
   Daintree's personal passion for the science of geology profoundly
   structured the colonialist narrative of his exhibitions, which combined
   the latest apparatuses of scientific knowledge and imperial
   communication, revealing him to be an innovative and internationally
   significant creator of synthesised exhibitionary experiences.},

   Slides},
Journal = {HISTORY OF PHOTOGRAPHY},

Volume = {41},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {188-203},
Abstract = {This article examines the production and consumption of illustrated song
   lantern slides. Motivated by the commercial success of Tin Pan Alley
   songs, slide companies began illustrating songs with live action
   photography in the early years of the twentieth century. Shown between
   reels of film, the slides were an attraction themselves and an integral
   part of the filmgoers' experience. The photographic experimentation in
   these slides, especially that of the firm Scott and Van Altena, is
   surprisingly novel. They frequently use multiple photograph negatives to
   exaggerate spatial and scale differences or frame narrative scenes. The
   author concludes that the layering and scale differences frequently seen
   in these slides allowed the company to expedite manufacture by recycling
   photographic images and also appealed to a popular taste for visual
   tricks in modern American visual culture. Although the imagery was
   nostalgic and conventional, the compositions challenged the viewer to

Abstract = {This article explores what it means to write a cultural history of the
   flash gun, the apparatus used to explode flash powder between the late
   nineteenth and the mid twentieth centuries. Finding safer, more reliable
   ways to ignite magnesium and its compounds was a priority for over forty
   years for those photographers who wished to light up darkness, whether
   their field of operation was deep underground or in their own living
   rooms. The article argues that by paying attention to a piece of
   equipment used to create artificial light, rather than to more customary
   topics of photographic history, we can see the interdependence of the
   many different materials that come together in creating a photographic
   image, as well as the intersection of technology, inventor, and
   practitioner. Moreover, this focus underscores that when it comes to the
   history of the technology surrounding photography, invention,
   adaptation, and improvement are happening simultaneously on many fronts,
   with a loose network of practitioners - amateur and professional
   photographers, and employees of photographic companies - working in both
   competition and collaboration in their attempts to tame the
   unpredictability of compound flash powder.},

Title = {Modernist Photography and Women's Social Networks: The Case of Olive
   Cotton and Margaret Michaelis},
Journal = {HISTORY OF PHOTOGRAPHY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {41},
Number = {3},
Pages = {241-261},
Abstract = {This article's title refers to the larger project of illuminating the
   social networks informing Australian artistic communities from the late
   colonial period to the middle of the twentieth century. Focusing
   primarily on developments in photography, the article itself asks what
   were the links between creative practices and the social relationships
   that characterised the modernist period in particular? It attempts to
   answer this question by examining the relationship between two
   retrospectively celebrated women photographers working in the war years
   in Australia - Olive Cotton and Margaret Michaelis. For a fair portion
   of their lives Cotton and Michaelis lived in the same city, worked
   contemporaneously in the relatively small field of studio photography,
   and shared similar artistic and commercial ambitions, yet they had
   virtually no professional or personal contact with each other. There is
   some evidence to suggest that social networks played a role in training
   early Australian women photographers, particularly those working in the
   professional studio system between the 1890s and the 1920s. Social
   networks would take on an explicitly political role in the
   consciousness-raising feminist context of women's photography in
   Australia from the 1970s to the 1990s. Given that Cotton and Michaelis
   were professional photographers during the interval between these
   periods, one is bound to ask whether their lack of contact had a
   personal basis or there was a wider more socially determined reason. In
   other words, was there something about the social conditions effecting
   Australia's artistic associations at this time that explains the lack of
   artistic connections between women, and if so was this lack the same
   across all the arts or particularly pronounced in photography?},

Abstract = {Like past avant-garde movements, glitch and noise in the twenty-first
   century are used to reveal the materiality of the medium. But instead of
   providing insight or clarity into the politics or social conditions of a
   technology, they demarcate broader conditions of opacity and blockage,
   contributing to what Jodi Dean has called communicative capitalism'. The
   work of German photographer Thomas Ruff alongside the Du..sseldorf
   School, New Photography and JPEG technology are used in this article to
   illustrate this tendency as a move away from meaning and toward visual
   noise and communicative breakdown. I use three core analytic registers:
   the deliberate failure to adhere to visual norms, communicative failure
   and machine failure and breakdown. Ruff's work uses visual noise as art
   to at once reaffirm pervasive conditions of breakdown, failure and
   decline in high-tech global capitalism, while simultaneously providing a
   temporary reprieve from these conditions through an emergent form of
   visual beauty.},

   that appeared as a photography book in 1984 and as an exhibition at the
   Israel Museum in Jerusalem in 2017, to unpack the differences between
   these two instances. Shofar's 1984 project portrayed young Mizrahi
   Musrara men while being interviewed by a Jerusalem municipality social
   worker. This collaboration had political potential but only fragments of
   these interviews are reproduced in the book. Although the men
   participated in the Black Panthers' protests, the book underscores their
   ethnicity and avoids mentioning this movement. My study explores the
   visual and discursive elements that depoliticised the book due to the
   Black Panthers' perceived threat to the hegemonic social order and in
   relation to local developments in photography as fine art. I show that,
   unlike the book, the 2017 Israel museum exhibition promotes Born in
   Israel's relation to the Black Panthers, but also had limitations and
   contradictions. Finally, I argue that accounting for the unabridged
   interviews uncovers hegemonic Israel's patronising attitude towards the
   marginalised photographed men, and compensates for lacunas in this
   project's presentations.},

Abstract = {In 1976, Anne Wilkes Tucker became the founding curator of the
   Photography Department at the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, going on to
   organise more than forty exhibitions, publish dozens of articles and
   books, and fundamentally shape the museum's collection of more than
   thirty thousand photographs. This article situates Tucker's early career
   in the context of the 1970s `photo boom' in the USA, a period of fervent
   interest and activity around the medium of photography. The article
   particularly examines the reframing of (some) photographs as serious art
   collectibles, and the intersection of the nascent market for
   photographs, the establishment of new museum collections and the
   proliferation of different forms of photographic scholarship during this
   period.},

Abstract = {Wisconsin Death Trip, the 1973 book by Michael Lesy, juxtaposes Charles
   van Schaick's nineteenth and early twentieth-century photographs of
   townspeople in Black River Falls, Wisconsin with local newspaper
   clippings of grisly murders and crimes. Drawing from police laboratory
   protocols, forensics manuals and case law, I show how Lesy's book
   imitates contemporaneously developed law enforcement techniques for
   presenting, justifying and interpreting photographs as evidence, which
   it uses to make a historical claim about death and madness in rural
   America. Ironically, the book's mimicry of these techniques creates its
   blind spot: Lesy is unable to see how Van Schaick's photographs actually
   relate to the indigenous Ho-Chunk people of the region and their
   struggle against forced removal by the US government. Studying Wisconsin
   Death Trip demonstrates how the interpretive momentum generated by a
   forensic approach to archival photographs too easily identifies the
   wrong crimes and perpetrators.},

Title = {Carlos Relvas's Stereoscopic Photography: The Digital Reunion of
   Negatives and Prints},
Journal = {HISTORY OF PHOTOGRAPHY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {44},
Number = {4},
Pages = {231-248},

Abstract = {European stereoscopic photography owes a significant part of its
   cultural specificity to amateur photographers who resorted to the wet
   collodion process to document nature with reduced exposure times and to
   perfect their photographic art with crisper and more detailed images.
   The Portuguese Carlos Relvas (1838-94) was one of these renowned
   collodion practitioners. Until recently, most of his stereoscopic
   collections remained undigitised and unstudied, and the contribution of
   stereoscopy to the launch of his international career was little known.
   The building of an online catalogue raisonne dedicated to Relvas's
   stereoscopic photography has been an opportunity to undertake a combined
   study of his stereoscopic negatives and prints, making it possible to
   retrieve new information about the extent, importance and evolution of
   his stereoscopic work. While designed to make these collections
   digitally available, the catalogue offers a new perspective on the
   specific value of stereoscopic negatives and cross-referenced `image
   families' for a new understanding of photographic practice. By

Abstract = {This article discusses two eras of manipulated photography -that of
   trick photography before 1914 and that of photomontage of the 1930s. The
   former had a carnivalesque character, while the latter highlighted
   political satire. Although profusely discussed in its days, trick
   photography was largely anonymous. By contrast, the 1930s brought about
   distinct personalities such as John Heartfield or the Soviet cartoonist
   Boris Klinch as well as prominent theorists, including Karel Teige or
   Gunther Anders. Despite formal differences the article argues for a
   continuity of approaches: both periods represent steps that question
   photography as a medium that claims stable signification.},

Title = {The Photomontage Activity of Postmodernism},
Journal = {HISTORY OF PHOTOGRAPHY},

Month = {APR 3},
Abstract = {For decades now, Douglas Crimp's landmark 1980 essay `The Photographic
   Activity of Postmodernism' has shaped our understanding of modernism's
   aftermath, at least as it unfolded in North America and Western Europe.
   Less remembered, however, is the degree to which the procedures of
   disjunction, copying, appropriation, and outright theft that he
   highlighted were epitomised not just by contemporary photography, but by
   photomontage in particular. This article recovers the debates that led
   critics such as Crimp, Abigail Solomon-Godeau, Christopher Phillips,
   Benjamin Buchloh and others to turn to photomontage as one of their
   principal objects of concern in what became known as the postmodern
   critique of photography. Why was montage tasked to perform this critical
   function, particularly by people around the journal October who had not
   otherwise devoted the balance of their writing to photography's history?
   The article suggests that these men and women, along with the
   contemporary artists they foregrounded, manifested what Mary Anne Doane
   has called a `desire for signification', a reaction in the late 1970s
   against the mute theatricality of minimalist and conceptual art.
   Photomontage reintroduced representation to contemporary art and to the
   canon of art history. But unlike the reemerging illusionism in painting
   that also manifested this desire, montage guarded against an
   uncomplicated realism by highlighting and critiquing operations of
   representation in a manner that painting no longer could.},

Journal = {HISTORY OF PHOTOGRAPHY},

Pages = {159-170},
Abstract = {Hannah Maynard was a prolific photographic portraitist who opened her
   first commercial studio in Victoria, British Columbia, in 1862. While
   she maintained a conventional commercial practice, her creative
   photographic work began to assimilate and respond to significant
   societal shifts in unconventional ways. In the 1880s Maynard started to
   experiment with a variety of avant-garde' techniques including photo
   collage, photo montage, photo sculpture, and multiple and composite
   images. In her late series of multiple exposure self-portraits, the
   integrity of the self and of the image, an imperative of conventional
   photographic portraiture, comes into question. Through a metaphorical
   relationship with spirit photography, these self-reflexive images toy
   with the distance between realism and surrealism, between coherent self
   and spectral other, and between the living and the dead.},

   Canadian North},

Volume = {40},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {From 1937 to 1939, Lorene Squire was commissioned by The Beaver (the
   company magazine of the Hudson's Bay Company) and Canadian Airways to
   produce photographs of the Canadian North suitable for their
   publications, focused on her specialisation in wildfowl photography, as
   well as landscapes, planes, and people. This article focuses on her 1938
   commissions, and in particular two photographs of Indigenous women and
   two self-portraits. When these photographs are considered alongside
   photographs of white settler women, her correspondence, and her book
   Wildfowling With A Camera (1938), I argue that they offer insights into
   gender as a colonial concept (what Maria Lugones calls the
   colonial/modern gender system'). I contend that the setting of the
   North' as a psychical landscape makes Squire's contestations possible.
   Squire's photographs resist common ways of depicting white and
   Indigenous women in the 1930s, but they do so in a way that is
   paradoxical and leaves intact the colonial/modern gender system. In
   addition to providing biographical information about Squire, this
   article contributes to theoretical and historical scholarship on the
   meaning of photographs of Indigenous people in Canada for projects of
   nation-building and northern economic development, as well as on how the
   North functions as a reference point for Canadian identity.},

Abstract = {Recent theoretical work on the Mediterranean has emphasised the sea as
   an agent of `connectivity' over a highly fragmented space, bringing
   peoples, goods, languages, and ideas into contact. Early photography in
   the Mediterranean manifests this connectivity and mixedness across the
   whole field of its practice: among photographers, sitters, printers,
   dealers, consumers, patrons, and even the photographs themselves.
   Focusing on the eastern Mediterranean, this article treats early
   photography in its `Mediterranean' context: located within a space of
   multiple languages, ethnicities, and religions, of personal and
   commercial networks between cities and across borders, and of spatial
   and social circulation and exchange. Such an approach complicates the
   two prevailing scholarly narratives of Mediterranean photography: one
   based on place, nationality, or ethnicity; the other on Orientalism.
   Seen in this light, the early history of photography in the
   Mediterranean may have implications for understanding the ways in which
   modernisation took hold and operated in the region.},

Abstract = {Ansel Adams first travelled to Hawai{''}i in 1948 for a project covering
   the US national parks and monuments. He returned in 1957 and 1958 under
   commission from the Bishop National Bank of Hawaii (now First Hawaiian
   Bank) to produce the centennial publication The Islands of Hawaii. The
   photographer's visits coincided with the US territory's postwar campaign
   for statehood, which began in 1947 when the first postwar bill for
   statehood appeared before Congress and ended in 1959 when Hawai{''}i
   became the nation's fiftieth state. This article considers Adams's work
   in the islands within the context of the postwar Hawaiian statehood
   campaign and in relation to the photographer's previous work at the
   Manzanar Relocation Center. Focusing on Adams's photographs of island
   residents within The Islands of Hawaii in relation to discourses of race
   and nationhood in the mid-twentieth century, this article begins to
   develop a line of inquiry into the artist's political engagements
   outside his well-known conservation efforts.},

Abstract = {Call me naive to be shocked when the following article was killed by
   fiat just as it was poised to be published in a Mary Ellen Mark
   catalogue accompanying C/O Berlin's fall 2023 one-person show of her
   photography, Encounters (16 September 2023-18 January 2024). I should
   have been better prepared after one friend familiar with C/O Berlin
   doubted after reading my draft that they would publish anything
   insufficiently laudatory. Thus forewarned, I was especially pleased by
   the initial positive response of C/O curators to the text I submitted
   three months ahead of press time. They warned me they were on a tight
   schedule and precisely because I like the idea of mixing up a
   predictably laudatory monograph with a more reflective essay, I made a
   point of meeting every request for cuts and revisions.Given my
   determined hoop-jumping, I thought all was going swimmingly when we had
   passed the official deadline of 1 July for submission to Steidl and they
   already had wired their fee to my bank. Then, on 10 July, an email
   appeared on my laptop titled `bad news' - I would be happy to quote it
   verbatim except that might open me to suit. In so many words, the
   message explained that when the curatorial team very recently submitted
   the entire typeset text to the Mary Ellen Mark Foundation, they
   encountered strong objections to my essay. They allowed that if they
   were not pressed for time to have a catalogue in hand by the September
   opening, there might be compromises. But up against the deadline - for
   some reason they had not mentioned back in April that this ultimately
   would get vetted by the photographer's foundation on which they depended
   for prints and use of reproduction, and strangely they only sought final
   approval just before going to press even though they had a draft of my
   text much earlier - they resolved to simply axe the essay and hoped that
   the writer's fee already wired to my bank would now serve as a kill
   fee.When I asked for more details about the Foundation's objection that
   my essay had too many factual errors, the comments I was shown, except
   for one minor issue, consisted of protests to my interpretations. I had
   hardly concealed my judgements, but I also thought I had given clear
   reasons for them. I also thought that some readers might be impressed
   that I not only considered the work seriously, but also, after starting
   off questioning Mark's self-described documentary mantle, I ultimately
   conceded a documentary attribute to Mark's doubled portraits. Clearly
   the Foundation folks could tolerate no criticism of work or approach by
   their hallowed subject. In an era when censorship seems to rise to
   epidemic proportions, I resolved to find an alternative platform.I have
   been on a portrait kick lately and I happen to think that this text
   makes a useful companion essay, if arguably somewhat contradictory, to
   one I researched, wrote and actually had published during the pandemic
   period of enforced isolation.1 It remains my hope that followers of
   photography and contemporary image-making might have access to more than
   hagiographic cant that foundations controlling rights to reproduction
   seem to foster. I like to think this article offers a salutary attempt
   to take photographic portraiture seriously but with none of the rhetoric
   of idealised revelations that gloss the transaction initiated usually by
   the photographer. We hardly need more reflexive affirmations that
   already gild the photographic pantheon. If my article generates public
   refutation as well as expansions on these ideas, all the better.
   In my opinion, photographic discourse could use more bite and less balm
   to counter the hoary rhetoric of photographic pictures being either a
   universal language or the proverbial equivalent of a thousand words.},

Abstract = {This article examines the photographic career of Stefano Lecchi, the
   Italian photographer best known for his series of photographs
   documenting the aftermath of the defence of the Roman Republic in 1849,
   a key episode in Italy's nationalist movement, the Risorgimento. This
   study concentrates on the album Fotografi di Roma, which presents thirty
   of Lecchi's salted paper prints from that series together with eleven
   topographical views. This album demonstrates how the events of the
   Risorgimento expanded the existing canon of Italy's historical monuments
   to include new sites identified with contemporary political actions that
   in turn contributed to the collective memory of the founding of the
   nation. Using newly discovered biographical information and highlighting
   the transnational network of colleagues and patrons surrounding this
   album, the author proposes the significance of these photographs to
   Italian nation-building across the political spectrum and posits Lecchi
   as an important, although often neglected, figure in the early
   development of paper photography.},

Abstract = {Founding curator of the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Department of
   Photographs, Maria Morris Hambourg's impact on the field of photography
   is incalculable. Across a multi-decade career, Hambourg influenced the
   canon of photography through largely monographic exhibitions. I use the
   terms searchlight and lighthouse as metaphors to describe her influence
   on curation and scholarship as well as the passion that focused her
   in-depth research. Hambourg's interest in the print process and
   photographic papers in tandem with historical context has been an
   important model for the generations of photography historians and
   curators that succeeded her. A committed expert on nineteenth-century
   France, Hambourg built relationships with photography collectors and
   conducted material and biographical research on artists such as Eug \&
   egrave;ne Atget, Nadar and Gustave Le Gray. Acknowledging her focus on
   European, white male photographers, I position Hambourg's exhibitions
   and writing as an important foundation for later research and
   scholarship that more thoroughly untangles histories of power, race and
   class, within the same canon she helped construct.},

Abstract = {The art historical congress organised for the 1877 Rubens Year in
   Antwerp led to the establishment of a committee to collect Rubens's
   works through engraved and photographic reproductions (1880-1910).
   Arguing that the art historical notion of oeuvre originated from the
   increasing reproducibility of works of art, this article contextualises
   the Committee's collection and the fifty-year history of its public
   display. It does so to reveal the changing perception of graphic and
   photographic reproductions between the end of the nineteenth century and
   the interwar period. Whereas the two technologies were originally used
   interchangeably to obtain a comprehensive picture of Rubens's oeuvre,
   they were eventually understood to fulfil separate functions; the first
   artistic, the second documentary. As a consequence, the Antwerp
   collection of Rubens's oeuvre became dispersed.},

Abstract = {Despite recent feminist scholarship on women's roles in the American
   Civil War (1861-65), their photographic participation remains poorly
   understood. As a result, women's wartime entrepreneurialism has not been
   recognised, and neither has their agency in shaping the image economy
   and visual history of a nation-defining conflict. This article presents
   the first dedicated research on Elizabeth Beachbard, an elusive figure
   who ran an ambrotype portrait business in Louisiana during the conflict.
   This article charts her trajectory from downtown New Orleans to a
   military camp in rural Louisiana where she photographed soldiers during
   the summer of 1861 until her death only months later. I consider the
   gendered constraints on women's photography of the epoch and the
   methodological challenges for researching female photographers,
   examining the historical context for women's entrepreneurialism and the
   circumstances that led to Beachbard's business model. As well as
   analysing her practice as a female operator in a military camp, this
   article presents new evidence for an ambrotype hitherto unattributed to
   Beachbard, which constitutes only the third extant example of her work.
   I contend that Beachbard should be seen as a pioneering figure in the
   history of women's photography, and might be considered America's first
   identifiable female photographer of war.},

Abstract = {Although Joe Rosenthal's 1945 Associated Press photograph of US soldiers
   raising an American flag at Mount Suribachi has been the subject of
   countless books and articles, none have discussed in depth the
   circumstances surrounding its publication in Life magazine. First
   published in American newspapers in February 1945, Rosenthal's
   photograph of Iwo Jima was not published in Life until a month later,
   due in part to the editors' scepticism surrounding its authenticity.
   Drawing upon new archival research, this essay recounts the initial
   response of Life's editors to the image, and reveals why they delayed
   publication. Both building on and in dialogue with previous scholarship
   surrounding the production, reproduction, and reception of this historic
   and controversial photograph, this article provides a powerful case
   study of how quickly a single image can be transformed from a
   documentary war photograph into a patriotic representation of American
   triumph in war, and ultimately into a universal, international symbol of
   victory.},

Abstract = {When an anonymous German critic once referred to Peter Henry Emerson as
   the `Courbet of England', Emerson's photographic depictions of the lives
   of England's rural peasants could not have been far from mind. Despite
   this, many scholars have largely overlooked the social meaning Emerson
   ascribed to these peasant labourers, instead focusing on his more
   vociferously argued aesthetic programmes. The present article addresses
   the significance that England's peasantry had for Emerson, and the
   particular role photography played in the depiction of this social
   class. Through a more intertextual approach than has been undertaken in
   previous studies, I conclude that Emerson perceived the East Anglian
   peasantry as a paragon of natural, well-ordered labour, in contrast to
   the labour in disarray emerging in many colonial locales. Emerson
   represents, then, a peculiar kind of imperial subject, using photography
   to construct the imagery of well-ordered labour for a similarly
   positioned imperial audience. These claims are demonstrated through
   recourse to more recent photographic scholarship on the construction of
   historical imaginations, as well as little studied volumes from
   Emerson's oeuvre, such as his Cuban novel, Caoba, the Guerilla Chief.},

Abstract = {Identity photographs used for official employee passbooks at the 1893
   World's Columbian Exposition provide a way to restore visibility to some
   of the massive workforce of employees and officials who are otherwise
   missing in conventional representations of this event. As a tool for
   documentation, a method for the mass production of images and a vehicle
   for constructing individual identity, identity photography had multiple
   functions at the Exposition. The professional photographic studio of
   James and May Gibson, working on site, demonstrates the kind of business
   acumen that was a requirement for the successful mass production of
   identity photographs. Workers were the key to successful Exposition
   businesses, and the food workers and employees of the Wellington
   Catering Company, the leading food concession, were crucial to the
   company's huge financial success. Removed from their original passbooks,
   273 photographs of the company's employees illustrate that for many
   workers this form of photography was more than just an image of
   identification, but also an opportunity for a statement of personal
   identity.},

Abstract = {This article revisits an obscure episode in the early history of colour
   photography, the collaboration between poet and inventor Charles Cros
   and painter edouard Manet. I consider the genesis of a colour
   photographic copy of Manet's Jeanne (Le Printemps) painting of 1882, a
   work featured in the recent exhibition Manet and Modern Beauty. I argue
   that more can be said about the intermedial layers of this experiment
   from a social, historical and theoretical perspective. Based on letters
   previously unexamined in the scholarship, I provide additional
   historical context about the experiment and reveal that it was not a
   one-off whim of the inventor, but rather a project that involved Jules
   Carpentier, the engineer who, among other achievements, would go on to
   collaborate with the Lumiere brothers in building their cinematographe
   camera. Finally, I consider more closely the sentiments expressed by
   Cros in a letter to Manet about the experiment, sentiments that, I
   argue, help open onto broader questions about the progress of chemistry
   at that historical moment. I conclude with a theoretical question about
   the incunabula of new technologies and their connections to an
   `environmental unconscious'.},

Abstract = {Stereoscopy initiated a dimensional shift that freed representation from
   the laws of geometric optics and longstanding conventions of linear
   perspective, creating aesthetic possibilities that were first explored
   by now obscure stereo-photographers. The late nineteenth-century rupture
   in the pictorial order' that Hubert Damisch attributes to Paul Cezanne
   has a genealogy that includes stereoscopy, the debates about binocular
   space perception that it occasioned, as well as innovative photographic
   work for the stereoscope. Through reading Hippolyte Taine, Cezanne was
   aware of the Berkelean idea that binocular space is not seen, but rather
   assembled from visual and tactile sensation sampled across time. The
   problem that this understanding posed for representation led many to
   insist that binocular space could only be invoked through synthetic
   apparatuses like the stereoscope; others argued for new conventions of
   planar representation, or binocular painting'. The visual evidence from
   Cezanne's work suggests that he paid attention to prescriptions for
   binocular painting and also to the new pictorial language developed by
   stereo photographers. Stereo photographers in the 1850s and 1860s, by
   abandoning perspectival conventions and proposing a constructivist
   conception of space, helped to transform Western visual culture in
   hitherto unappreciated ways.},

Abstract = {The invention of photography in the late 1830s is conventionally framed
   in terms of simultaneous rival developments by a few well-known figures
   in England and France. Less attention has been paid to how early
   photography was shaped by a wider cast of individuals placed in both
   metropolitan and regional networks of science and applied arts. Drawing
   in particular on recent studies on networks and the geography of
   science, this article examines the significant but frequently overlooked
   contributions made to early photography by the chemist and popular
   science writer Robert Hunt (1807-87) as a way to open up questions about
   the spatial networks of early photography. Based in southwest Britain,
   and from a relatively humble background, Hunt experimented widely with
   early photographic processes. He used correspondence with key figures of
   Victorian science, notably Sir John Herschel, to share his knowledge and
   build a reputation within influential networks of early science and
   publishing. This article argues that Hunt's foundational contributions
   to early photography - which were widely recognised in the half century
   after his death - need to be better appreciated and understood within
   the setting of spatial networks of science and applied arts at various
   scales. These include regional networks, such as those in Cornwall;
   metropolitan circles in London; national networks, such as the British
   Association for the Advancement of Science; and national and
   international networks of publishers and readers. As an examination of
   Hunt's work demonstrates, accounts of early photography may profit from
   paying more attention to the networks and places in which photographers,
   photographs and writings on photography were located.},

Abstract = {This article analyses the work of Colombian photographer Fernell Franco
   through a comparative study with the work of Mexican cinematographer
   Gabriel Figueroa. Through the vast production and dissemination of the
   melodramatic genre, Mexican cinema became a paradigmatic referent for
   some artists working in the context of a radical urban transformation in
   the cities of Colombia during the second half of the twentieth century.
   Indeed, Franco's work developed simultaneously with his close
   relationship to and immense fascination with popular Mexican cinema.
   This article utilises the notion of melodrama as a `fictional system'
   that permeated the work of Franco, drawing upon Mexican movies'
   mise-en-scene, dramatic lighting and the close relationship between two
   Mexican melodrama subgenres: the vecindad (tenement) and the
   prostitute's story. The article proposes two ways of understanding
   Franco's images. On the one hand, they speak about the conditions of
   displacement in Colombia and, on the other, they characterise what has
   been termed the `tropical gothic'. Lastly, the article discusses the
   importance of postproduction techniques and materiality in Franco's
   work, focusing specifically on the Interiors series.},

Month = {JAN 2},
Abstract = {Photographic history took root in the discipline of art history with its
   focus on pictures, and subsequent critical histories have largely
   retained this image-centred focus. Yet there is no inherent reason why
   the study of photography needed to become a history of pictures
   especially, as in some respects the images might not be the most
   important aspect of the practice. In recent years there has been a
   flurry of studies examining aspects of photographic industry and
   business arrangements. In this article I present some debates from the
   field of academic business history, which raise issues of relevance for
   historians of photography. Reese V. Jenkins's influential study of
   Kodak, Image and Enterprise (1975), provides the opportunity for

Abstract = {In the second half of the nineteenth century, the Montefiores were an
   international Jewish family including prominent bankers, insurers, and
   merchants. Four brothers of the family were also leading members of the
   amateur photography movement in Britain, Belgium, France, and Australia.
   An album containing photography now in the State Library of New South
   Wales in Sydney, but made by Eliezer Levi Montefiore in the Colony of
   Victoria, reveals aspects of his family's identity. The album reflects
   their role in the British colonisation of Australia, as well as their
   interest in the development of Australian national identity. The
   enthusiasm for photography manifest in the album was shared by the
   brothers across national borders, and so also reflects their
   transnational, diasporic experience. Furthermore, the album represents
   aspects of the family's class and gender identities, and functioned as a
   kind of visual primer for its recipient, Eliezer's young daughter,
   Caroline.},

Abstract = {James Brady was a mid twentieth-century Indigenous political organiser,
   trapper, prospector, writer, and intellectual. He was also a prolific
   photographer. This article considers the significance and aesthetics of
   Brady's photographic archive through the lens of Indigenous visual
   sovereignty. Brady was Metis-one of Canada's three recognised Indigenous
   peoples along with First Nations and Inuit. The Metis engaged in two
   conflicts with the Canadian state and negotiated the entry of a province
   into confederation. For a significant period of history, they lived
   outside Canadian infrastructures, whether the system of First Nations'
   reserves created in the post-treaty era or Euro-Canadian settlements.
   Particularly vulnerable to land loss and displacement, the Metis were in
   desperate condition when Brady first began travelling with his camera.
   Brady's photographs document the political rebirth of Metis people and
   the resilience and persistence of Metis communities in northern Alberta
   and Saskatchewan. They bear photographic witness to the lived experience
   of sovereignty rooted to place and continue to resonate with his
   subjects and their descendants.},

Abstract = {This article casts a retrospective glance at the technological continuum
   from which the art history slide lecture springs. The article focuses
   specifically on the copy apparatuses widely used to make transparencies
   for art-historical consumption, circa 1930 to the early 2000s. The ways
   in which these once prevalent technologies developed to frame and
   disseminate visual materials by means of light was instrumental in
   shaping the widespread illusion of epistemological transparency in the
   world's art history classrooms. In reference to the work of Martin
   Heidegger (1889-1976) on technological determinism, the author provides
   a chronology of slide reproduction technologies in which artworks
   ultimately appear as self-luminous technological `images', or simulated
   entities that speak as if beyond history.},

Abstract = {Reproductions of artworks were a crucial element of official narratives
   aimed at shaping Polish identity after World War II. In this article, we
   explore the strategies employed in constructing visual messages in the
   first volume of the book series Ziemie Staropolski (Old Poland's
   Territories) titled Dolny Slask (Lower Silesia), published in 1948 and
   devoted to the Western territories ceded to Poland after the war. In our
   case studies, we discuss such aspects as, on the one hand, framing,
   lighting, viewpoint and selection; on the other, geographical, political
   and social contexts. We propose two notions to explain the political use
   of reproductions. The first is geohistorical medium, which we employ in
   reference to how reproductions actualise the meanings of artworks in
   relation to geography and history. The second is affective reproduction,
   which we use to address deliberately shocking arrangements of
   reproductions with photographs that include ruins, artworks or people.
   We emphasise that both strategies aim at a specific group of viewers
   whose experiences oscillate between memories of war and hopes for the
   future. The reproductions we discuss participated in the construction of
   the postwar geopolitical order in Central Europe.},

Abstract = {Stationed in cities, towns and villages across the Indian subcontinent,
   the colonial police were a ubiquitous presence under the British Raj.
   Visuality was central to the policing project; the police's
   effectiveness was predicated on colonial subjects' recognition of police
   authority. Photographs of policepersons and police buildings, appearing
   in manuals, histories and memoirs, private albums, imperial educational
   propaganda and on postcards, testify to the pervasiveness of the
   policing institution within the colonial landscape and the institution's
   commitment to visuality. The sheer volume of these photographs invites
   consideration. While existing scholarship on the colonial police and
   photography has largely focused on how the police harnessed the medium
   in their efforts to visualise colonial criminals, this article considers
   photography as a means of producing the police to make legible the
   imperial social order. Various photographs of policepersons and police
   buildings - mundane and propagandistic images when considered within the
   broader history of colonial Indian photography - index imperial
   interactions, revealing the visual language the police relied on to
   assert their authority.},

Journal = {HISTORY OF PHOTOGRAPHY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {41},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {171-187},
Abstract = {Two examples of photographic montages from the first half of the
   twentieth century, one by the Modern Sketch Society in the magazine
   Shidai manhua and the other by the photographer Lang Jingshan, craft
   images of the modern Chinese nation. Although dramatically different,
   both images rely on assemblage formats and the photographic fragment in
   order to present a vision of a new China within a larger global context.
   This article proposes a nineteenth-century precursor to these
   photomontages in the form of an 1885 Shanghai magic lantern show as
   presented in the pages of the pictorial magazine Dianshizhai huabao.
   Originating as a lecture on world travel by the Chinese pastor and
   educator Yen Yung Kiung, the lecture was reconstituted into a
   lithographic series by the famous illustrator Wu Youru. Intended
   simultaneously as entertainment, as an educational and charity event,
   and as a series of lithographic and photographic images, the
   heterogeneous components of Yen and Wu's travelogue bring together a
   complex but coordinated vision of the nation. Like a photomontage in its
   constant juxtaposition of pictorial pieces, this transmedial `Tour round
   the world' strives to offer a particular view of China and its place in
   the modern world.},

Abstract = {This article explores the transnational visual language of picture
   postcards and the international business networks responsible for
   producing and disseminating the image of Dutch colonialism around 1900.
   Following a microhistorical approach, I consider the multilayered
   representation and transnational production of one particular postcard
   sent from colonial Indonesia to the Netherlands in 1900. The postcard
   established, visualised, and catalysed colonialism through its use of a
   European visual language. Colonialist meaning was attached to the image
   in Germany and was reinforced through the process of the postcard's
   delivery from colony to metropolis. This article moves beyond a
   nation-based framework and instead analyses the meanings of colonial
   imagery in transnational contexts.},

Abstract = {This article investigates the relationship between ancient objects and
   their visual depiction in British archaeological expeditions in the
   Middle East in the mid-nineteenth century. The article focuses on the
   exploration of Ancient Mesopotamia initiated by the British adventurer
   Austen Henry Layard. Modern scholarship on Layard's excavations and
   their reception in Europe has mostly presented them as well-organised,
   purposive, and logical enterprises in which finding objects and
   depicting them had a clear, well-defined purpose. Little attention has
   been paid to the fact that the excavated items were initially objects
   without a clear status, even after they had arrived in Europe. This
   article examines how the application of visual media - whether used for
   scholarship or for publicity - in the field and the museum reflected
   this uncertainty. In this context, photography as a new medium entered
   the chaos of the field and the museum as one among several media that
   brought along its own insecurities rather than a tool ready and able to
   solve a problem.},

Abstract = {Canadian photographer Richard Harrington has been recognised since the
   1950s for his photographs of the Arctic, and specifically for portraits
   of the Padleimiut taken at a hunting camp in 1950 during a winter of
   acute shortages. Three were selected for Edward Steichen's The Family of
   Man (1955). Of that group, two focused on motherhood through depictions
   of childbirth and maternal love; the latter is sometimes referred to as
   `Canada's Madonna and Child', making a timeless secular icon from the
   representation of a crisis. Harrington was a documentary photographer
   who made his living as a freelance photojournalist specialising in human
   interest stories and travel features for magazines and newspapers. On
   assignment in British Columbia for the Hudson's Bay Company magazine The
   Beaver, he photographed a First Nations mother and child, an image
   entitled `Madonna of the Peace'. This photograph later graced the cover
   of a Roman Catholic missionary magazine, Pole et Tropiques. This article
   draws parallels between Harrington's photographs of Indigenous mothers
   and children and Dorothea Lange's Migrant Mother, using Harrington's
   diaries and community-based research to reconstruct the lives of his
   subjects, and considering the sacrifice of knowledge to iconicity.},

Abstract = {At the turn of the twentieth century, landscape photography began to
   emerge as a new way to represent nature in Korea. Landscape photographs
   of the Korean peninsula were printed in modern media, such as the daily
   newspaper Maeilsinbo, the public cultural magazine Cheongchun, and
   picture postcards. This article explores the photographic representation
   of nature in Korea in the 1910s. Landscape images of the period were
   rooted in the visual regime of the camera obscura, and they often
   borrowed techniques and themes from Korean traditional landscape
   painting, or sansuhwa. The photographic medium was important in shaping
   new perceptions, aesthetic experiences, and discourses on nature. This
   article examines several categories of landscape photography, including
   images of scenic and historical places, idyllic and bucolic scenes, and
   urban parks. These categories were common in Korean western-style
   landscape painting and art photography of the 1920s, and continue to be
   seen to this day in Korean visual culture.},

Abstract = {In the late 1880s and early 1890s, a small number of professors -
   including Charles Diehl, Louis Courajod and Henry Lemonnier - started
   projecting photographic reproductions in their art history classes in
   France. They were among the first to teach the subject in the country's
   universities. This newly accessible technology enabled artwork-based
   demonstrations in the classroom for large audiences, complementing and
   eventually replacing paper photographs, plaster casts and other methods
   of reproduction. From the mid-1890s, demand for slide projections in
   universities was reinforced by the popularity of educational slideshows
   in French culture. They would become omnipresent in art history
   departments by World War I. This article explores when and why the
   projected photograph was adopted by art historians in lecture halls, the
   ways in which individual professors employed and discussed slides, and
   how their respective institutions invested in this activity. I argue
   that for the educators who instituted slide projection, the practice was
   about grounding the young discipline's methodology in the analysis of
   empirical data. It gave concrete form to scientific enquiry and was
   attractive to students. Showing slides was thus a powerful practical and
   ideological tool in the establishment of art history as an academic
   discipline in France.},

Abstract = {Throughout his 1887 photographic atlas, Animal Locomotion, the
   photographer Eadweard Muybridge uses the serial, instantaneous imagery
   of chronophotography - a medium typically associated with the automated
   mechanisms of industrial productivity and scientific analysis - against
   the economies for which it was developed. This article aims to identify
   a subcategory of works in the series termed `inoperative images',
   meaning photographs that both depict non-productive gestures - such as
   dancing, posing and lying down - as well as those sequences that, thanks
   to mechanical failures, inconsistent time intervals or the rearrangement
   of plates, ultimately proved useless for physiological analysis. Where
   previous scholars have attributed Muybridge's lack of rigorously applied
   scientific method to a desire for an aesthetic product, these
   inoperative images may also be understood as creative resistance to the
   mechanisation and industrialisation of photographic labour in the last
   quarter of the nineteenth century. In this context, a different
   understanding of Animal Locomotion as an anti-industrial document comes
   to light, one that illustrates how the mechanical may work against the
   goals of purpose-driven, standardised time and objectivity.},

Abstract = {The history of photography has generally been conceived of in terms of
   technical advances, aesthetics, genre or oeuvre. This article proposes
   that other histories become apparent when materiality is foregrounded.
   To support this proposition the study focuses primarily on one portrait
   photograph and its embedded history, which is evident in its shifts in
   material form. The photograph under consideration is of Cornelius, more
   familiarly known as Con Colbert, a minor figure in the Irish Rising of
   1916. His memory came to exceed the life of a man, and to understand why
   this was the case it is necessary to focus on the mediated presence of
   his portrait image in a culture of remembrance. What Colbert's portrait
   makes evident is that a photograph is a material object which carries a
   history in its transferences, display formats and layered meanings.
   Photographs do things, they have agency, are affective and, in turn, are
   effected by cultural needs and interpretation. In other words, it is
   proposed that a history of the photograph is embedded in the exchanges
   and uses to which it is put which cannot be separated out from choices
   of material form.},

Journal = {HISTORY OF PHOTOGRAPHY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {40},
Number = {4},
Pages = {432-452},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Characterised by their determination to get close to the action, the
   Australian combat cameramen of the Second World War made a significant
   contribution to the evolution of the war photographer into the dynamic
   figure familiar today. This is especially true of their intimate
   documentation of the vicious encounter with the Japanese in New Guinea
   and other islands of the Southwest Pacific, which went beyond
   professional bravery. A large corps of official photographers shooting
   for both government and military agencies expressed the racial ideology
   of a war fought against an opponent who was increasingly loathed as the
   war progressed. Their pictures of Australian triumphs over the Japanese,
   including graphic and often deliberately demeaning pictures of dead and
   captured enemy, reflected the exigencies of wartime propaganda. But they
   also expanded on a frame of cultural reference derived from decades of
   anxiety about the threat of invasion by Japan, and reveal an abiding
   national view of the battlefield as the definitive arena for a contest
   of rival masculinities. Australia's war in the Pacific has attracted
   increasing scholarly and popular attention in recent years. However, the
   enormous archive of official photographs has been largely ignored,
   except as a source of illustrative material. This article argues that
   the archive needs to be read as a collective text in its own right, for
   the significant insight it provides into Australian cultural as well as
   military and geopolitical insecurities.},

   Minimalist Theory of Photography},

Abstract = {Robert Smithson's photography is commonly associated with conceptual art
   and its watershed critique of the apparatus's documentary mode. On this
   basis, interpreters like Douglas Crimp, Craig Owens and Jeff Wall have
   all positioned Smithson as a key precedent to the expanded field of
   lens-based practice, keyed to the complex concept of the `picture' that
   emerged following the artist's death in 1973. However, a careful review
   of the artist's work and writing reveals that his implicit theory of
   photography could also be meaningfully described as Minimalist - attuned
   to this quasi-sculptural movement's concerns with the clarification and
   renewal of spatiotemporal perception. Smithson's 1969 travelogue,
   `Incidents of Mirror - Travel in the Yucatan', for instance, sets up a
   number of pointed equivalences between photography, Minimalist sculpture
   and select ancient Mesoamerican ritual objects designed - according to
   Smithson's understanding - to expand perception onto new planes of space
   and time. In recent years, scholars such as Walter Benn Michaels have
   advanced the idea that Minimalism's problematics offer key insight into
   late twentiet - century photography's foremost questions regarding the
   nature of this technology and its presence effects, in particular those
   that have long been associated with its indexicality. As this article
   demonstrates, Smithson's camera work engaged meaningfully with these
   same problematics, evincing a decidedly materialist yet radically
   expansive new conception of photographic picturing.},

Abstract = {From the moment small consumer cameras became available in Australia in
   the early twentieth century, Ngarrindjeri people embraced photography as
   a means to record their history, and represent their families, aesthetic
   traditions, and worldviews against the perilous times of attempted
   assimilation by the state, including the rampant forced removal of
   Aboriginal children that came to be known as the Stolen Generations. In
   analysing a collection of rare historical photographs from this period,
   taken by Ngarrindjeri photographers and retained in Ngarrindjeri
   families, we bring the perspectives of contemporary Ngarrindjeri Elders
   to bear. Significantly, the photographs can be observed to operate both
   as a rich counter archive to colonial representation and settler memory,
   and as esteemed cultural objects capable of drawing the weight of the
   ancestral past into the present moment, thereby tangibly enlivening
   cultural and spiritual connections generationally today. Our exploration
   in this article provides new theoretical perspectives and fresh
   historical insight into the ways in which photography has been
   substantially deployed by an Australian Aboriginal nation as a subtle
   and potent tool to assert self-determination, document survivance, and
   enact visual sovereignty.},

Volume = {46},

Month = {JAN 2},
Abstract = {At first glance, it appears as though Sir Joshua Reynolds's The Ladies
   Waldegrave (1780) is in two places at once: Strawberry Hill House and
   the National Gallery, Edinburgh. Despite their visual
   indistinguishability, however, the former is a copy of the latter
   created by Factum Foundation in 2018. In this article, I discuss the
   ontological relation between paintings and their visually
   indistinguishable facsimiles, along with certain consequences that
   relation has for display practices. Traditionally, paintings are
   understood to be ontologically singular; no copy, however faithful, can
   ever stand in as the work itself. Using The Ladies Waldegrave, I defend
   ontological singularity while maintaining that these visually
   indistinguishable facsimiles can be used to promote engagement with, and
   a better understanding of, originals. Drawing on the philosophical idea
   that objects have temporal parts, I suggest that what I call suitable
   facsimiles - copies that are visually indistinguishable from originals -
   are representations of particular temporal parts of those originals. My
   proposal allows paintings to maintain their singularity while
   acknowledging that some copies share a special relationship with the
   originals such that the former can stand in for the latter. I conclude
   by considering issues concerning the display of both originals and
   suitable facsimiles.},

Abstract = {This article examines the photographic subject of the return of Austrian
   prisoners of war in the aftermath of the Second World War. Scholars and
   curators have singled out what are known as the homecomer' photographs
   by the Austrian photographer Ernst Haas, praising their artistic quality
   and assigning these works an iconic status. This approach has obscured
   the broader historical background of this subject as well as the
   editorial practices, collaborative efforts, and propagandistic
   intentions of these works in the field of photojournalism. In contrast,
   this article focuses on the immediate historical and political context
   of returning prisoner-of-war photographs in the Austrian illustrated
   press, arguing that they were part of a broad visual discourse
   deliberately adopted by the postwar media for the purposes of Cold War
   propaganda.},

Abstract = {Histories of the carte de visite and the photographic album rarely
   consider adequately the intersections between modes of viewership
   associated with collecting and archiving, and assertions of national
   identity in the nineteenth century. Alessandro Pavia's Album dei Mille,
   completed in 1867 to commemorate the Expedition of the Thousand, a
   defining episode in the Italian Risorgimento, presents the portrait card
   of 824 of the 1,092 men known to have participated. The photographs are
   ordered alphabetically and erratically sourced - although Pavia took
   many in his own studio - and bound into a massive album. The Album
   mobilises practices of viewing and organisation that come from both the
   archive and the collection, constituting a case in which contradictory
   modes of constructing narrative, engaging historical time, and
   understanding the materiality of photography produce a complex mode of
   viewership significant to the histories of photography and identity
   construction in the newly formed Italian nation. Seen from the purviews
   of the collection and the archive, this episode in the history of
   photography has implications for understanding how the album and the
   portrait card shaped the way photographs were viewed and used in the
   second half of the nineteenth century, and more specifically in
   nation-building movements such as the Italian Risorgimento.},

Journal = {HISTORY OF PHOTOGRAPHY},

Pages = {217-240},
Abstract = {Leopold Szondi invented a projective test using photographs of people
   with mental pathologies to determine the unconscious, ancestral
   illnesses (or aptitudes) of his subjects. Szondi's images were garnered
   from psychiatric textbooks published around 1900. Such photographs
   presumably revealed unconscious thoughts, desires, and destinies in the
   course of a test session. If a patient responded positively to a
   photo-portrait of a diagnosed hysteric', for instance, this indicated
   that the subject herself had unconscious, inherited hysterical traits.
   Szondi's reasoning was predicated upon two commonly held fallacies:
   first that an individual's physical appearance is the external marker of
   mental life, and second that photography is a transparent means of
   revealing true facts. In spite of (or maybe even because of) such
   problematic assumptions, Szondi's use of photographs can be located
   historically in a tradition of reading human character from portraiture.
   The test was widespread, and was even administered to Adolf Eichmann at
   the time of his trial in Jerusalem - an ironic cultural development as
   Szondi himself would have been among the thousands of Jews deported from
   Hungary directly to Auschwitz by Eichmann had the Szondi family not been
   rescued by the Kastner train of 1944.},

Abstract = {The St. Louis World's Fair of 1904 was an occasion for celebrating the
   USA's purchase of the State of Louisiana and the American government's
   recent annexation of the Philippine Islands. So that Americans could
   familiarise themselves with the people from their latest acquisition,
   hundreds of live Filipinos were placed on display at the fair. Also
   featured were Asian people from a variety of Pacific Rim nations. A
   small group of women photographers were charged with the responsibility
   of photographing these visitors. This essay focuses on the work of two
   of these women - Emme and Mayme Gerhard from St. Louis. The essay
   examines some of the more stereotypical images of Japanese, Chinese,
   Alaskan and Filipino subjects they produced at the fair alongside images
   they created that awarded the same ethnic groups humanity and identity,
   asking how should we understand this seeming tension in their work? Was
   it the result of an implicitly imperialist mode of photography practised
   by white middle-class women as Laura Wexler has claimed, or were there
   other important factors at play?},

Abstract = {This article looks at how aesthetic concerns inflected the dynamic of
   imperial relations during the 1857 Indian Uprising and its aftermath.
   The invention of photography inaugurated a period in which aesthetic
   imperatives increasingly came to structure the engagement of colonial
   bodies with the traumas of warfare in British India. The formal
   conventions of image-making practices were not consigned to a discreet
   virtual sphere; they were channelled into the contested terrains of the
   subcontinent through the poses that figures were striking for the
   camera. I trace how one pictorial convention - picturesque staffage -
   had the capacity to engender politically and psychologically disruptive
   tableaus on the contested terrains of empire, as colonial photographers
   arranged for Indian figures to pose on landscapes that were marked by
   disturbing wartime violence.},

Abstract = {In this essay I argue that the diverse archive of stereoscopic imagery
   has not so far been properly read historically - that is, in relation to
   its material and discursive context. The early-nineteenth-century
   context was characterised by multiple positions in debate which can be
   used to make sense of three broad projects of stereoscopic
   representation. The first, naive realist project was to subsume
   stereoscopy under geometric optics and to claim for it verisimilitude to
   the thing represented, and in the process leave unchallenged the
   conventions of perspective painting as a model of how we actually see.
   The second was to embrace the stereoscope's contribution to a
   long-standing critique of the anomalies of binocular `natural vision'
   and to explore a new pictorial logic of geometrically impossible objects
   in geometrically monstrous space - an aesthetic that I begin here to
   document. This was not so much a project of `realism' as of
   verisimilitude to a radically transformed conception of natural vision -
   one that had already begun and would continue to undermine the `truth'
   of perspective convention. The third project was anti-realist, inspired
   by evidence that spatial perception was not determined by external
   stimulus but rather constructed through the intervention of a sometimes
   capricious spatial imagination.},

Abstract = {This article traces the circulation of photographs taken in Beijing in
   1865 and 1866 by Georges Morache, a medical doctor stationed at the
   French legation. Including sights of the city, portraits and staged
   outdoor scenes depicting local trades, these pictures were disseminated
   from the mid-1870s in two directions simultaneously. While they were
   issued for about twenty-five years as wood-engraved reproductions in
   illustrated travel publications, they also circulated up until 2003 as
   prints and lantern slides within anthropological institutions. This
   article examines the diverse material and semiotic adaptations that
   these photographs were subjected to along their twofold circulation. Not
   only verifying the mutability of photographic meaning, this case also
   highlights affinities between the concerns of institutionalised
   anthropology, popular education and illustrated travel publications in
   the late nineteenth century. Ultimately, the dynamic circulation of
   these photographs in the West fulfilled a popular desire to scrutinise
   Chinese people and culture - a desire that was contingent on the
   informal empire upheld by western powers in China since the Opium Wars.},

Abstract = {This article investigates late nineteenth-century Ottoman illustrated
   journals as a key site for the articulation of new, popular, and
   visualised forms of historical knowledge and sensibility in the imperial
   domain. Focusing on the reign of Sultan Abdulhamid II, a period from
   1876 to 1909 marked by the beginnings of print industry and rising
   levels of literacy in the Ottoman world, the article situates
   photography within a mixed, hybrid, and highly image-based media
   environment that radically transformed Ottoman modes of looking and
   remembering. Allowing new forms of reading, viewing, and popular
   participation, the journals helped refashion and pluralise collective
   images of the empire's material past. The article argues that the new
   visions of history and antiquity that emerged in the Ottoman journals
   were not merely an ideological package imposed by the state and
   passively consumed by the readers. The journals played an essential role
   in creating a highly visualised interface where popular and official
   forms of historical imagination mingled and interpenetrated.},

Abstract = {Six camera obscura installations by New York-based artist Zoe Leonard,
   made between 2011 and 2014, offered spaces of imagination that were both
   primal and timely. These darkened rooms, with their wondrous projected
   images, did not `redefine photography' - an untenable claim that is all
   too readily made in the discourse of contemporary art. Rather than look
   at photography and its many technologies categorically, it would be
   better to assess the perceptions that individual photographic works
   afford on the technological situation of their time. Leonard's
   installations threw into relief the false interactivity and utter
   commodification of the self that dominate in today's e-culture -
   problems addressed in recent writing by Jonathan Crary as well. They
   heightened awareness of our fleeting human vision, leading to an
   intensity of thought and feeling without a portable or recorded image.
   With their invitation to contemplate reversibility at several levels -
   including, importantly, the switching between oneness and aloneness that
   stands at the heart of a living community - these works permitted a
   critical and poetic respite from conventions of our all-too-mobile
   moment.},

Abstract = {The arrival of police radio inaugurated a vast and punitive new media
   ecology. Between the 1920s and the 1950s the installation and
   implementation of police radio systems - now ubiquitous and utterly
   naturalised - in towns and cities across the USA restructured the
   practice of policing and the experience of being policed. These
   processes radically revised the social, psycho-geographic and
   spatiotemporal relations unfolding amid the new medium's localised
   atmospheres of broadcast, reception and swift weaponised response. Image
   makers working in a range of media, including painters and news
   photographers, operated within this atmosphere. Positing police radio as
   a vital and violent representational infrastructure, this article tracks
   its technological reordering of municipal space as tactical policed
   space, both as this space was given to appear in Municipal Law
   Enforcement, a large oil painting created circa 1950 by Kansas City
   police officer Charles M. `Pat' Murray for his department, and as this
   painting was reproduced, and its signal thereby amplified
   photographically, both locally and nationally by daily newspapers.},

Abstract = {`What she captured is just gold', says Dallas Phillips. She is talking
   about the photographs taken by her mother, Mavis Phillips, nee Walley,
   one of Australia's earliest known Indigenous photographers. Representing
   an extremely rare perspective of life during protectionist and Native
   Welfare times from a Ballardong Noongar point of view, the Mavis Walley
   Collection (MWC) existed for decades as negatives kept in an old
   chocolate tin before coming to light at an oral histories workshop in
   Goomalling, Western Australia. By way of its knowledge-based digital
   archive, Storylines, the State Library of Western Australia worked with
   Mavis Phillips's family to restore and disseminate 325 of these
   negatives in 2015. This article argues that the MWC significantly
   differs from heritage photographs taken by non-Indigenous photographers
   in subject, composition, and style, expressing the joy and spontaneity
   of the photographer and her sitters. A product of intercultural
   collaboration between an Indigenous family and a non-Indigenous state
   institution, the MWC disrupts the pictorial record of Western Australian
   Indigenous history, shedding light on the rich past of a connected and
   thriving Ballardong Noongar family in Goomalling.},

Abstract = {Photographic book production in Germany in the interwar period reveals
   immense inconsistencies and divergent trends. Predominant themes involve
   a shifting discourse between a pessimistic nostalgia for an apparently
   disappearing, slower pace of life and a more optimistic, technological
   utopianism, with dividing lines set between the old and the new, the
   urban and the rural, and between progress' and tradition'. As the
   National Socialist era approached, however, there was a largely
   successful assimilation of these disparate, antagonistic elements of
   German culture in an attempt to create a sense of continuity rather than
   disruption. Collectively, photographic books provide a register of
   conflicting, contemporary concerns and anxieties. This article
   investigates how their variant discourses point to the complex realities
   of German interwar cultural politics.},

Journal = {HISTORY OF PHOTOGRAPHY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {41},
Number = {3},
Pages = {286-310},
Abstract = {Charles S. Peirce's late-nineteenth-century semiotic theory has long
   been considered one of the key frameworks for analysing the photograph
   as a visual sign. This article, however, proposes a closer look at
   Peirce's contemporaneous philosophy of pragmatism as a fundamental
   component of the visual, cultural, and intellectual context within which
   the photographic halftone first emerged. When, exactly, did it begin to
   matter if a photographic image made up of a certain arrangement of
   graphic marks was read differently from a photographic image made up of
   a different arrangement of graphic marks? Such pragmatist questions were
   crucial to the early reception of halftone reproductions, which were
   often integrated into illustrated magazines as simply one element within
   an already diverse array of graphic codes. Turning to Jacob Riis's How
   the Other Half Lives (1890) as a case study, this article argues that
   reading the halftone as a chiefly photographic sign was not in fact an
   inevitable outcome of its introduction into the illustrated press in the
   1880s and 1890s, but required instead a constant negotiation of both
   visual and conceptual imprecision - an imprecision eventually smoothed
   over in favour of an association of halftone technology with
   photographic ontology by the early twentieth century.},

Abstract = {Between the 1930s and the 1990s, as art museums across the USA began
   contending with what place photography might hold within their
   programmes, key individuals framed photography's value in language that
   itself deserves consideration. Amid this museological reckoning with the
   medium, at the National Gallery of Art, which was established in the
   1930s as a national public repository for Western art of the highest
   standards, the question of whether and how photography might fit into
   that lineage presented new questions. How would the greatness of
   photography be defined? What would its presentation look like? Sarah
   Greenough joined the National Gallery of Art in 1978 with a PhD in Art
   History and an expertise in the work of Alfred Stieglitz. I argue that
   as she aimed to integrate photography seamlessly into the set of values
   established by Andrew W. Mellon at the founding of the Gallery, she drew
   upon Stieglitz's own terminology for valuing the medium, modelling her
   own philosophy of its import on his notion of `the idea photography'.},

Abstract = {This article explores innovations in photographic production and
   experimentation in Australia, especially Sydney, from 1935 to 1940.
   While many photographers and photographic societies were still promoting
   the aesthetics of Pictorialism, others were responding to new demands
   and opportunities provided by publishing, advertising, international
   expositions, local exhibitions and architecture. After introducing some
   of the forces for change, where there was often an easy exchange between
   photography and design, the article examines four case studies from 1937
   to 1940. Three of these were generated by international expositions; all
   involved different types of photomurals and collaborations across the
   arts. These collaborations were instrumental in helping to shape
   Australian modernism and a postwar recovery within the arts.},

Title = {Photographic and Prophetic Truth: Daguerreotypes, the Holy Land, and the
   Bible According to Reverend Alexander Keith},
Journal = {HISTORY OF PHOTOGRAPHY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {42},
Number = {4},
Pages = {338-355},
Abstract = {In 1859, Reverend Alexander Keith published the thirty-seventh edition
   of his Evidence of the Truth of the Christian Religion Derived from the
   Literal Fulfilment of Prophecy; Particularly as Illustrated by the
   History of the Jews and by the Discoveries of Recent Travellers.
   Included in the illustrations were eighteen engravings from
   daguerreotypes, presenting the landscape of Palestine and Syria in order
   to demonstrate the fulfilment of Old Testament prophecies regarding its
   desolation. In this article, Keith's use of photographic reference is
   presented as it relates to the illustration of specific biblical texts
   and to his evangelical characterisation of the camera's empirical point
   of view. Keith's notion of photographic truth, while grounded in the
   mid-nineteenth-century's conceptualisation of the medium's indexical
   science, is revealed through his theology of the literary landscape, his
   telescoped teleology, and the more than human' capacity of the lens. The
   author argues that with the interdisciplinary engagement of biblical
   studies a deeper critical understanding of such an explicitly
   confessional position attributes greater complexity and specificity to
   the role of religious ideology in shaping early Holy Land photography.},

Title = {Windows Onto Things:The Phenomenology of Glass in Josef Sudek's
   Photography},
Journal = {HISTORY OF PHOTOGRAPHY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {42},
Number = {2},
Pages = {185-201},
Abstract = {Over fourteen years, Czech photographer Josef Sudek photographed three
   windows in his small ramshackle Prague studio at least a hundred times.
   This project, The Window of My Studio, meditates on the frost, dew, and
   dirt that accumulate on the window's glass, and the still lifes that
   emerge in the margins. Sudek's focus on the often opaque pane becomes an
   analogy for the limits of human vision. I argue that the abstract glazed
   surface and the repetitive nature of Sudek's windows exemplifies Maurice
   Merleau-Ponty's description of a multifaceted and infinitely variable
   object. However, I also challenge Merleau-Ponty's dismissive attitude
   towards the medium of photography by suggesting that Sudek's process and
   photographs reveal a phenomenological gaze. Sudek's window series led to
   a long rumination on the phenomenology of glass through photographs. His
   following two projects (Still Lifes and Labyrinths) revolve around
   still-life photographs of glass panes, cups, vases, and lenses. Glass,
   an object that reveals, reflects, and transforms its surroundings,
   becomes a promising metaphor for embodied human perception. This article
   takes Sudek's persistent and even obsessive use of glass in his still
   lifes seriously. His engagement with his subjects, similar to a
   painterly relationship with the world, allows for a slower philosophical
   exploration of the world through photography. When considered as
   cohesive projects, Sudek's photographs reveal a complex internal
   phenomenology - one that relates to our own being in the world.},

Abstract = {This article examines the networks that form an archive using variations
   on a single photograph from the Thomas Rodger studio of St Andrews.
   Using the concept of a `thick thing', the article charts the
   trajectories of photographs of Bronze Age funerary urns as they left
   Rodger's studio, were collected in albums and used in lectures, and
   returned to the University of St Andrews Special Collections. Taking
   just one of Rodger's photographic assignments as a prism allows us to
   think about the circulation of many of his photographs both during his
   lifetime and after, as both the creation of `thick things' and as
   `material performances' that have since gained the title `Early Scottish
   Photography' in the St Andrews Special Collections. From a humble object
   photograph and its variations, the article argues for the agency of the
   photographs and their studio origins in forming the special collections'
   photographic collection, and making, in a very literal sense, the stuff
   from which we write history.},

Abstract = {The author's discovery of a set of inscribed photographs of the Bandits
   of La Jalancha', made in La Paz, Bolivia in 1871 and now in the
   collections of Harvard's Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology,
   has made possible the identification of the photographed gang's leader
   Salvador Chico' with the Afro-Aymara anti-hero known in contemporary
   folklore as El Zambo Salvito. On their photographic journeys out of
   Bolivia, Salvador and his men were transformed into anonymous Indian
   bandits' and became generic illustrations of ethnic Aymara types in the
   service of racialised evolutionary science. Back in La Paz, however, the
   photographs were forgotten but the legend of the infamous son of an
   African slave from Chicaloma, a coca-producing hacienda in the region of
   Yungas, grew in the public imagination. Whereas nineteenth-century
   racial discourse only recognised his indigeneity, twentieth- and
   twenty-first-century folklore and illustrations have instead emphasised
   his blackness. In tracing the split legacies of Salvador of Chicaloma,
   through exported photographs and the formation of local legends, this
   work reveals how identity was constructed, evacuated, and made anew.
   This fluidity of representation was made possible, in part, by the
   relative archival invisibility of afrodescendientes in Andean South
   America, whose lives and histories remain largely uninscribed.},

Abstract = {From her early photographs of the ruinous aftermath of the Lebanon War
   in Beirut (1982) to her more recent images of bomb craters in Eleven
   Blowups (2006), the French artist Sophie Ristelhueber has been intent to
   maintain, in her own metaphor, `the analytical distance of an anatomy
   lesson'. Exhibiting the evidence of warfare but withholding their
   explanation, Ristelhueber's provocative gesture of making art of war,
   removing human conflicts from their political contexts to render them as
   still-lifes, ready-mades, earthworks, or surrealist poems, is patently
   anti-journalistic. In keeping with the artist's surgical analogy, this
   article explores Ristelhueber's aesthetic mode of address as one that
   shares its fundamental operation with that of photography - namely, to
   make a cut. Retracing the morphology of recurring imprints and injuries
   that appear across the terrestrial and corporeal expanses traversed in
   her work, the article considers the ways in which these cuts pertain to
   the transformative power of violence and images alike.},

Abstract = {This article investigates the political ramifications of the Japanese
   postwar revisiting of the nineteenth-century photographs of Hokkaido, a
   northern island colonised by the Japanese empire in 1869. Compared with
   the programme of American Western Settlement, the Hokkaido Colonisation
   Project actively adopted photography as an efficient means of
   documentation and communication. The historical photographs of Hokkaido
   were reinterpreted by postwar avant-garde artists, who hailed them as
   the origin of documentary photography in Japan. This return to the
   archival records was the ironic result of an artistic response to the
   social milieu of the 1960s, when state ideology and Cold War politics
   were heavily imposed on Japan.},

Abstract = {Over the last decade, 35mm slide libraries that were used to support art
   history teaching in higher education in Europe and North America have
   been widely dismantled and dispersed. This article examines the cultural
   values that have been illuminated by debates about their decline and
   disposal, and the contexts and practices for their afterlife. Drawing on
   auto-ethnographic research, interviews with former slide librarians and
   surviving slide library material, the article pays special attention to
   one case study, formerly held at the University of Brighton, UK, to
   trace the slide library's establishment and demise, examine the cultural
   labour of its production and maintenance, and evaluate its
   particularities and idiosyncrasies. Through this, the article outlines
   the values and meanings that were established and contested during the
   slide library's working life and its 2011 dismantling, and considers how
   these have been repositioned in the intervening years. The slide
   library's devaluation contrasts sharply with slides' recent revaluation
   in scholarly interests in photographic materialities and media
   archaeologies, in the retro marketplace and in contemporary art
   practice. Together, these reflections and frameworks provide fresh
   perspectives on dismantled slide libraries and their remains.},

Abstract = {The launch of the Royal Mail's parcel post service in 1883 was
   concurrent with the increase of amateur photographers in Britain,
   supporting new ways for this group of practitioners to come together
   through postal photographic clubs. This article explores the influence
   that members' participation, in assembling and distributing the
   portfolios shared by each club, had on photographers' understanding of
   their own role in the production of photographic meanings and values. It
   does so by discussing the postal service as a technology of
   communication and transport; the virtual space created through
   circulating portfolios as a modern network; and the conjoint acts of
   writing, reading and looking at photographs that constituted each
   portfolio as reframing photographers' idea of self. The article covers
   the period from the early 1880s to the early 1910s, by which time postal
   photographic clubs had become almost ubiquitous in Britain. The article
   demonstrates that this process implicitly challenged the
   institutionalisation of this period's dominant photographic discourse.},

Abstract = {This article examines the photomontages, photo-sculptures,
   installations, and videos of contemporary artist Sheida Soleimani in
   light of earlier Dadaist practices. In particular, it focuses on
   similarities and differences between Soleimani's work and that of Dada
   artists John Heartfield, Hannah Hoch, and the Baroness Elsa von
   Freytag-Loringhoven, demonstrating how Soleimani has evolved Dada
   photomontage and performance strategies in novel and important ways.
   Soleimani's development of earlier avant-garde strategies with the help
   of digital technologies, I argue, proves the continuing relevance of
   photomontage today. In addition, it also reveals Soleimani's interest in
   combining a Dadaist approach to photography, which - through
   photomontage - emphasizes the artist's position as a social critic and
   commentator on reality, with a Surrealist attitude, one that mobilizes
   the indexical aspects of the photograph to disclose the uncanny and
   mysterious aspects of the world.},

Abstract = {In 1941, the Rath Packing Company of Waterloo, Iowa published a book
   titled Waterloo Packer: The Story of the Rath Packing Company to
   celebrate its fiftieth anniversary in the meatpacking industry. Modelled
   on Life magazine, Waterloo Packer co-opted the photoessay format to
   commercial ends. Examining archival documentation and looking at other
   American industrial publications, this article illuminates Waterloo
   Packer's conception by executives of the Rath Company and consultants
   from advertising agency Young and Rubicam; and it contextualises
   Waterloo Packer as the most innovative of a series of industrial
   biographies' produced in the USA at midcentury. Through close reading of
   Waterloo Packer as phototext, this article demonstrates how the Rath
   Packing Company deployed photographic imagery to present a controlled
   and sanitised vision of industrial-scale slaughter.},

Title = {Horacio Coppola: Towards an Aesthetic Genealogy},
Journal = {HISTORY OF PHOTOGRAPHY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {40},
Number = {4},
Pages = {388-412},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Although a milestone in the history of Latin American photography, the
   work of Horacio Coppola is little known outside Argentina. His
   unorthodox angles and tilting frames, his attention to industrial and
   urban themes, and his experimentation with different lenses in the
   period between 1927 and 1931 were in absolute synchrony with the
   precepts of European New Vision and New Objectivity photography, and
   with American straight photography. That Coppola's visual idiom was in
   tune with the latest photographic developments in interwar Europe is
   obvious. What remains unclear is how exactly he achieved that synchrony.
   Several scholars have wrestled with this question, which nevertheless
   remains elusive due to lack of evidence of direct contact with European
   photography prior to his studies at the Berlin Bauhaus in 1932 and his
   repeated attempts to downplay the influence contemporary photographers
   had on his work. The article provides a systematic study of Coppola's
   aesthetic genealogy and his photographic borrowings through a critical
   examination of his early pictures and theoretical writings. It teases
   out possible direct and indirect channels of dialogue with the New
   Vision, New Objectivity, and straight photography in the second half of
   the 1920s, and probes the reasons behind Coppola's reluctance to admit a
   connection with contemporary European photography in particular.},

Abstract = {In 1968 two generations of Japanese photographers came together to
   research and curate the most comprehensive exhibition of the history of
   Japanese photography to date. Examining five hundred thousand
   photographs from public and private collections across the archipelago,
   they ultimately presented 1,640 images in a widely attended Tokyo
   exhibition. Moving beyond photographic nationalism, A Century of
   Japanese Photography was one of the only instances of public critique of
   the role of photographers who collaborated with the Japanese state
   during the Fifteen Year War (1931-45) and the exhibition's popularity
   launched the movement to build the largest photography museum in Japan.
   Through analysis of the exhibition and establishment of the Tokyo
   Metropolitan Museum of Photography, I illuminate how the process of
   writing the first major history of Japanese photography and building an
   institution to house its archive was a practice informed by the changing
   meanings of the role of photographers and museums within Japanese
   society.},

Abstract = {In 1973, a Toronto magazine published the photographic bookOpen
   Passportby Montreal photographer John Max. A formally innovative
   narrative sequence about the dissolution of an artist's marriage, it has
   been a touchstone of Canadian photography since its publication.
   Simultaneously autobiographical, fictional, and experimental,Open
   Passportis a unique response to the representations of self and
   subjectivity in American photography of the 1970s, which championed the
   idea of photographers as authors and the book as privileged support for
   their images. Initially produced as an exhibition accompanied by a
   slideshow,Open Passportis a work that uses multiple supports for
   disseminating a photographic narration about the self. Using previously
   unavailable materials from John Max's archives, this article argues that
   these different supports should be considered as multiple variants of a
   single work, which upsets the hierarchical logic distinguishing original
   works from adaptations or derived works. This has important
   methodological consequences for the emerging field of photobook studies,
   which has given primacy to the history of books over that of
   exhibitions. The notion of performance is used to explain the
   relationship between the work and its supports, showing in turn the
   importance of the processes of editing and sequencing in the definition
   of the photographic work of art.},

Abstract = {By way of a dialogue between the two authors-an artist and an art
   historian-this article reflects on the artistic method of repurposing
   the colonial archive, in particular the vast collection of photographs
   of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. Important contexts for
   this work include the international practice, established in the 1990s
   amongst artists, communities, and museums, of addressing hidden
   histories of war and genocide in the public sphere. In Australia, this
   included challenging colonial visions and the damaging history of
   representing First Nations peoples. At the same time, Australian
   colonial archives increasingly became more accessible and an important
   cultural and political resource for First Nations peoples. This article
   considers both the debate around cultural protocols of Indigenous
   knowledge that has emerged in the last twenty years and the relentless
   ideology of primitivism that has restricted the visibility of Indigenous
   loss. Pervading these developments has been the persistent emotional,
   historical, and political dilemma of how artists access these archives
   and produce decolonial readings of the ` mess' and trauma of colonial
   events.},

   Company's 250<SUP>th</SUP> Anniversary Celebrations in Canada},

Abstract = {In 1920, the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) celebrated its 250(th)
   anniversary through national and international events, as well as
   honours and benefits for its employees. The year 1920 was an important
   moment for the HBC, as it underwent institutional change to support the
   expansion of its department store operations through public relations
   and advertising strategies. Central to these strategies was an emphasis
   on the HBC's central role in Canadian nation formation, and in
   particular its fur trade history. This article discusses the use of
   photography in the HBC's 250(th) anniversary celebrations through an
   analysis of photographs of fur. I trace photographic representations of
   fur through three moments: in the process of extraction (as trapped
   animal or dead pelt); in the process of preparation (as Indigenous bush
   labour); and in the process of consumption (as fur goods in a department
   store window). While the fur trade was declining in significance at the
   time of the 250(th) anniversary celebrations, its symbolic status was
   essential to the Company's burgeoning retail operations. In this
   article, I argue that the photograph of fur replaced the fur pelt as the
   central trade item of the HBC, and, further, that photography fused
   together nationalist and capitalist expansion in Canada.},

Abstract = {Between 1890 and 1893, two young Americans, Frank Swift Bourns and Dean
   Conant Worcester, travelled through the central and southern Philippines
   on a zoological expedition. In addition to collecting animal specimens,
   the two men took more than one hundred and fifty photographs. These
   photographs have not been given much attention by historians but they
   are an important set of images that help expand the understanding of
   photography in the Philippines in the late Spanish colonial era. This
   article discusses the circumstances surrounding the making of these
   images and provides a framework for interpreting their significance by
   applying the concept of the photographic obsessions' of Western
   explorers as defined and described by Willem van Schendel and his
   colleagues in the book The Chittagong Hill Tracts: Living in a
   Borderland.},

Abstract = {This article argues that body-camera relationships - issues of holding,
   mobility and display - informed the abstract qualities of some of Harry
   Callahan's early photographs from the 1940s. While these pictures have
   clear roots in earlier photographic precedents, they also engage
   problems related to those addressed by abstract painters of the same
   decade. The article positions Callahan's photographs as an independent
   contribution to this period's exploration of bodily experience and
   abstraction, but also suggests how camera-based photography from these
   years might complement and expand recent conversations about camera-less
   or process-based photographic abstraction.},

   Photonovel},
Journal = {HISTORY OF PHOTOGRAPHY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {42},
Number = {4},
Pages = {392-404},
Abstract = {The issue of the preservation of photographic heritage involves much
   more than vintage prints. Other unoriginal prints - that is, images we
   only know as reprints of (lost) original prints - are also a matter of
   concern, and the film photonovel may help raise significant issues in
   this regard that would otherwise risk being overlooked. At first sight,
   the specific medium of the film photonovel - that is, the reissue in
   photonovel format of original movies, a cultural practice that was
   extremely popular in the second half of the 1950s and the beginning of
   the 1960s - raises all of the questions that arise when discussing the
   materiality of photographic archives: issues of material fragility and
   decay, authorship and authenticity, and completeness and value. At the
   same time, the utterly uncanonical status of this corpus, sometimes
   described as the lumpen' version of what is generally considered an
   illegitimate genre, provides an opportunity to ask different kinds of
   questions with regard to the very definition of key notions such as
   photography, photographic record, and photographic archive. In this
   sense, the film photonovel opens a range of questions that continue -
   yet in a very different direction - Rosalind Krauss's provocative
   question on the discursive spaces of photography.},

Journal = {HISTORY OF PHOTOGRAPHY},

Volume = {41},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {329-342},
Abstract = {Like many authors of the long nineteenth-century period, Henry James was
   both fascinated and troubled by photography's capacity to extend social
   relations across distance and time. As this article will show, in The
   Awkward Age (1899) and `Crapy Cornelia' (1909) he represents photography
   as enabling new forms of virtual flirtation. The Awkward Age projects
   its protagonist, an adolescent girl named Nanda, into a network of
   photographic exchange. This leads to serious problems when her mother
   seeks to win Nanda a suitor. The text not only depicts photographs as
   modes of flirtation; it also shares with photography a concern for
   deixical signification. The book presents the identity of its individual
   characters through a blank writing style that is both flirtatious and
   photographic in its pleasurable deferral of meaning. By the time he
   wrote `Crapy Cornelia', James had adjusted to the new instantaneous and
   portable photography. As a result, this later story portrays obsolete
   carte-de-visite photography in nostalgic terms: as a form that enabled
   affective (and effective) networks of connection, even between the
   living and the dead.},

Abstract = {This article maps out the genealogy of the Korean term sajin, which
   began to be used as a translation for photography in
   late-nineteenth-century Korea. A genealogical study of the term sajin
   and its extension to the naming of photography provides a foundation to
   comprehend the processes in which the reception of photography as a new
   cultural product was framed by Korean indigenous practices of
   representation and their related cultural discourses. One of the main
   objectives of this essay is to highlight the fact that the concepts of
   photography and photographic technology were not simply imported into
   Korea from the West, but were actively recoded in ways that responded to
   established cultural and political discourses of Korea, and
   intercultural dialogues between East Asian countries. Emphasising the
   discursive specificity of photography in Korea, I move beyond the
   familiar discourse of centre and periphery that has shaped the narrative
   of western globalisation. This article will be of interest to
   contemporary historians and theorists of photography who are seeking
   alternatives to Euro-American notions of photography and its history.},

Abstract = {In the summer of 1966, the Japanese artist Yayoi Kusama installed
   Narcissus Garden in the main grounds of the 33rd Venice Biennale.
   Fifteen hundred mirrored plastic balls formed the core of a dynamic,
   complex work, which also included human agents, environmentally
   determined, ephemeral elements, and photographic images. The common
   thread, however, was the presence of the artist herself, captured for
   posterity in nearly every existing photograph of Narcissus Garden. Taken
   collectively, these images of Kusama and her work create a complicated
   amalgam of self-publicity and effacement, presenting a complex fusion of
   artist, image, and object. Photographs do not supplement the sculpture,
   Narcissus Garden, but function as an integral component of the work,
   acting as the connective tissue amongst its multiple parts.},

   Photograph of the Scottsboro Nine},

Abstract = {On 25 March 1931 nine young African Americans were arrested in Alabama
   for the alleged rape of two White women, nearly lynched, sentenced to
   death and eventually incarcerated for years. This article examines the
   arrest photograph of the Scottsboro Nine and enacts a `social biography'
   in exploring its conflicting uses in American media. The article
   proposes that it is an `averted lynching photograph' that echoes images
   of actual lynch mob killings. Southern newspapers used leading captions
   with encoded racial hierarchies that framed the Nine as violators of
   White womanhood. Conversely, radical media reframed the photograph,
   arguing that a `frame-up' trial constituted a `legal lynching'. The
   Communist organisation International Labor Defense led the campaign to
   acquit the defendants, and its magazine Labor Defender reproduced the
   photograph extensively in polemical photomontages. Diverse uses in
   African American media varied from analogous captioning in the combative
   Chicago Defender to its pertinent absence in the National Association
   for the Advancement of Colored People's forum The Crisis. Many of these
   media framings fostered the abjection and victimhood of the Nine,
   whether in condemnation or sympathy. The photograph was a site of
   contestation of conflicting values concerning race, in which the
   subjects had little agency.},

Abstract = {In 1942 photographer Andreas Feininger travelled across the United
   States documenting war industries for the Office of War Information, a
   New Deal agency. In the midst of world war, Feininger's straightforward
   photographs of plane production, copper mining, and other key industries
   were carefully crafted propaganda designed to combat German rhetoric and
   bolster public support and confidence in the war effort. Feininger's
   style, an admixture of modernist ideas and social detachment, found
   resonance within US ideological efforts that stressed data and facts,
   and became known as the `Strategy of Truth'.},

Abstract = {As Nadar shifted his attention from caricature to photography in the
   1850s, he produced several fascinating hybrid images. Among these are
   experiments in photomontage and uncommon portraits that combine graphic,
   photographic, and autographic elements. The author shows how Nadar
   cultivated a number of recognisable signatures, which he reiterated and
   adapted for different image-types, products, and advertisements. Nadar's
   investment in self-portraiture, his penchant for publicity, and his
   ability to work across platforms and to balance artistic ambition and
   commercial enterprise are explored in depth.},

   Athenian Antiquity},

Volume = {40},
Number = {3},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {William J. Stillman's 1870 photographic album The Acropolis of Athens
   details, with extraordinary sensitivity, the classical monuments of the
   Athenian Acropolis. But the album itself is part of a larger
   transnational history of the production, representation, and circulation
   of Greek antiquity. It is also a central artefact of Stillman's own life
   and affiliations. Tracing these two interlocking histories is to place
   the album's imagery, narrative, and informational material within the
   larger ambit of individual, national, and Euro-American politics,
   historical ideology and aesthetics. Stillman's album is centrally
   influenced by the German-led archaeological activity on the Acropolis,
   reflecting both its widely-held assumptions on the worth of Greek
   antiquities and the proper way to view them, as well as an ambivalence
   verging on antipathy toward indigenous Greek archaeological (and
   photographic) activity. This tendency complicates (but does not
   completely erase) Stillman's powerful sympathy and outspoken activities
   on behalf of Greek and Cretan independence and self-determination. The
   moment that produced Stillman's album is not the only one in which he
   photographed the Athenian Acropolis. Comparing his photography of 1870
   with his 1882 rephotography of the site is to find changes and slippages
   that highlight the vicissitudes of Stillman's own complex history. It
   also has significant implications for the imagery he produced earlier,
   connecting Stillman's work to the larger constellation of
   nineteenth-century imagery of the Athenian Acropolis.},

   Colony in Weimar Germany},

Abstract = {This article examines German colonial cultures in the post-World War I
   period following Germany's loss of a colonial empire. Photography had
   long been embedded in both the practical and ideological production of
   empire, but after 1918 took on an especially significant role in
   constructing a surrogate colony' that kept the colonial idea alive in
   the absence of direct colonial rule. The dynamics of this surrogate
   colony are especially evident in the publications of the organised
   colonial movement. Drawing on these publications, I argue that the
   colonial movement produced a surrogate colony that was as much about the
   management of gendered and racialised German populations as it was about
   propagandising for a return to colonial rule. Photography played a key
   role in bringing together two areas that underlay this gendered and
   racialised dynamic: science and commercial culture. I thus begin by
   tracing the way in which photographic scientific cultures, in particular
   in the fields of medicine, anthropology, and racial science, shaped the
   contours of the surrogate colony. These scientific cultures emerged in
   an unstable relationship with mass commercial photographic cultures,
   with the article then turning to an exploration of colonial fashion
   photography'. The foregrounding of clothing and bodies in this
   photography highlights the complex relationship between scientific and
   commercial photography, which is shown to be deeply implicated in the
   production of racialised and gendered forms of embodiment.},

Abstract = {In 1898 America made a dramatic switch from isolationism to an
   expansionist international agenda. After a short war with Spain, the USA
   acquired Guam and the Philippines, Congress agreed on the annexation of
   Hawai{''}i and Wake Island, and, shortly after, tripartite negotiations
   led to the acquisition of American Samoa. The USA had become a colonial
   power and acquired a Pacific ``empire'. In 1899 this new status met with
   the publication of Our Islands and their People as Seen with Camera and
   Pencil, a two-volume text that included twelve hundred photographs. The
   pictorialising or visualising of empire in the text was a publishing
   coup. Although historians have been reluctant to acknowledge the USA as
   an imperial power, the analysis here links the visual record of new
   territories in illustrated publications to expanded public awareness and
   a political debate that potentially took Americans to a new level of
   understanding of the Pacific Islands. The analysis of American ``empire'
   suggests that territorial expansion was a long-standing characteristic
   of the nineteenth century that was visualised in photographs for
   national debate.},

Abstract = {Having pioneered the use of photography as a diagnostic and therapeutic
   tool in portraits of his female patients at the Surrey County Lunatic
   Asylum in the 1850s, Hugh Welch Diamond is typically remembered as the
   `father of psychiatric photography'. This parochial label and the pathos
   of these well-known images have occluded our contemporary view of
   Diamond, who was regarded by his peers as one of the leaders of British
   photography. A recently identified album in the George Eastman House
   collection raises questions about our assumptions that Diamond
   approached photography purely in an instrumental or utilitarian way. In
   fact, the album suggests that at the same time as Diamond was immersed
   in the documentation of his patients, he was experimenting with
   dramatically expressive portraits in ways that forecast the work of
   pictorialists such as Henry Peach Robinson and Julia Margaret Cameron.
   The album's superabundance of portraits of women makes a compelling case
   for Diamond's preoccupation with the woman as muse, whether for the
   purposes of art or science.},

Abstract = {In this article I explore photogravure catalogues of the Berlin
   Photographic Company (BPC), a print publisher founded in 1862
   specialising in reproductions of works of art, and in particular those
   published by its New York office from 1892 to 1916. In promoting its
   reproductions, the BPC connected social, aesthetic and technical
   knowledge, emphasising the quality of photogravure technologies while
   listing hundreds of images from diverse styles, historical periods,
   genres and subjects to appeal to a wide audience. The Company was
   sensitive to its customers' cultural aspirations and recognised that the
   US market was different from that in Europe because of its less rigid
   class structure and a public motivated by ambitions for cultural
   knowledge and social mobility. With its wide range of reproductions from
   Old Masters, nineteenth-century popular and Academic artists, and later
   early twentieth-century modernists, the BPC appealed to these ambitions
   by providing photogravure prints - the company specialty - in different
   sizes, mounts and costs to a public of diverse tastes and economic
   means. The BPC's innovations included its global locations in Berlin,
   Paris, London and New York and its creation of neologisms combining
   format and process tying the materiality of photogravures to a range of
   sizes and prices.},

Pages = {319-337},
Abstract = {This article explores turn-of-the-twentieth-century occult photographic
   experiments by Louis Darget and Hippolyte Baraduc that eliminated the
   technological medium of the photographic equipment and worked with an
   altogether different kind of medium: namely, the so-called vital fluid'.
   These experiments fit into their era's aim for scientific objectivity;
   however, by striving to exclude the camera from the image-making
   process, they highlight the complex media-theoretical dynamics at work
   in Lorraine Daston and Peter Galison's mechanical objectivity'. It is
   these media-theoretical implications that form the subject matter of
   this article. I explore the tension between Darget's and Baraduc's
   photographic practice, which stresses immediacy even as it continually
   enacts medial tautologies'. Their attempts to capture the subtle media
   of effluvia reveal the presence of other media within the images: that
   of the technical apparatus (the emulsifying liquid) and that of the
   surrounding environment (the fluid of air). Thereby, their practice
   continually blurs the line between its object of representation and its

Abstract = {In his 1933 book La Trace de Rome dans le desert de Syrie, Antoine
   Poidebard, the Jesuit missionary, French spy, colonial servant, air
   force officer, and archaeologist, published 219 aerial photographs of
   archaeological remnants in the Syrian steppe, which he identified as
   pertaining to the ancient Roman limes. This article examines Poidebard's
   photographic reconfiguration of historical time and geographical space
   in the context of archaeology and historiography in Mandate Syria and
   Lebanon. The article argues that, in the absence of the archaeological
   groundwork that they were allegedly meant to enable, his photographs
   combined the appeal of a visible past with the promise of that past's
   potential future as an object of investigation. In the transitory and
   politically precarious situation of the Mandate, the rare record
   constituted by these photographs upheld a projected connection between
   ancient Roman and modern French civilisation in the geographical region
   of the Mandate.},

Abstract = {In the 1970s, Gilbert Gimon discovered the daguerreotype work of Jules
   Itier and subsequently published two articles: one in French in 1980 and
   one in English in 1981. The historical importance of this discovery is
   now firmly established and the two articles have become key sources of
   reference. However, a close study of these publications reveals mistakes
   and assumptions that require resolution. Part one of this article
   considers two phases of gathering and dispersal of this body of work,
   first in the mid-nineteenth century and subsequently in the twentieth
   century. Individuals, situations and institutions are identified in
   order to assist with the necessary corrections and reinterpretations. In
   part two, Itier's journal and Gimon's articles are cross-referenced in
   relation to new source materials in order to undertake an in-depth
   investigation of a number of plates presented in chronological order.
   This has resulted in the correction of a number of erroneous dates and
   statements made by Gimon. In the process, an unexpected new name in the
   early history of photography was revealed in relation to the earliest
   clearly dated photograph of India. This article concludes with a new
   reading of Itier's work and its significance for the history of
   photography in Asia.},

Abstract = {This article examines photographs taken by the American anthropologist
   John W. Bennett during the Allied Occupation of Japan. Bennett was Chief
   of the Public Opinion and Social Research Division of the Civil
   Information and Education Section of the Supreme Commander of the Allied
   Powers. In his photographs, Japanese women can be seen fraternising with
   GIs, working as prostitutes, and enjoying everyday life with their
   children. We see the occasional man farming the land, building a house,
   collecting human waste, or begging in Ueno Park in Tokyo but the new
   Japan and its future seems to be in the hands of women. For an
   Occupation that was initially intent on destroying Japan's war-making
   capabilities, the welfare of veterans was not a priority. Depicting
   women and children was a palatable way of representing Japan as a friend
   and ally.},

Abstract = {This essay aims to examine the beginnings of photography in the Moravian
   capital of Brno, which, albeit for a short period between 1839 and 1842,
   was the gateway for the dissemination of photography to Moravia, Silesia
   and Bohemia. With the support of learned societies and other
   institutions in the region, local photographers were able to keep up
   with recent advances in daguerreotype processes. The most proficient
   among these enthusiasts was the Premonstratensian and Professor of
   Physics at the local Philosophy School, Friedrich Franz. Six
   daguerreotypes preserved in collections in Brno, as well as our
   knowledge of the social and institutional context of their origin,
   provide the foundation for this study of the beginnings of photography
   in Brno, and in Central Europe in general.},

Abstract = {Edouard Manet's life and work have been studied using photographic
   sources that provide essential yet still underutilised information about
   his oeuvre and artistic process. Beginning in the 1860s, Manet employed
   the firm of Anatole Godet to photograph his paintings, probably as
   records of stock, and this article considers how Manet may have used
   these photographs as the basis for tracings and watercolours that served
   as intermediaries in the production of etchings after several of his
   canvases. Godet also photographed the posthumous retrospective of
   Manet's work in 1884, providing the only known images of that landmark
   exhibition. After Manet's death, Leon Leenhoff, the son of Manet's wife
   Suzanne Leenhoff, hired Fernand Lochard to photograph works remaining in
   the artist's studio, and in several other locations, to illustrate a
   corresponding inventory. The photographs were annotated by Leon with
   information about each work including its exhibition history and bound
   into albums. While select scholars have engaged with these important
   materials, Manet's use of photography and the role photography played in
   the posthumous dissemination of his works remain insufficiently
   understood. Taking Olympia as a case study, this article aims to
   demonstrate how these archival sources contribute to Manet studies.},

   Works},

Abstract = {The prominence of the large-format photograph in contemporary art since
   the 1970s is often attributed to the desire to explore new pictorial and
   spatial avenues by moving beyond the documentary approaches that had
   dominated since the 1930s. While not an inaccurate characterisation, the
   focus upon the artistic impulses associated with large-scale photography
   comes at the expense of the material issues that enabled it. This
   article addresses the gap by examining two largely overlooked forms
   produced by Ansel Adams between 1930 and 1960 - the photomural and the
   folding photo-screen - in order to demonstrate the high level of direct
   engagement that existed between photographer and materiality, which
   resulted in large-scale works that addressed many of the same issues
   dealt with in contemporary large-format photography, but that also stood
   in stark contrast to the ephemeral, mass-produced, large-scale work
   prevalent at the time. By considering historical examples, from an era
   when materials and processes were very different, the article
   demonstrates the active, physical effects of photographic enlargement,
   revealing print size to be not simply a changeable option but an
   inherently material condition, honing our understanding of why a
   photograph is big by demonstrating how it got that way.},

Abstract = {In the mid-1870s, Robert Crawshay started a now-forgotten contest
   designed to promote the development of direct life-size photography in
   Britain and the advent of a more objective photographic portrait. The
   contest saw much enthusiasm and many entries, but, as this article
   argues, ultimately ended up setting back the very causes it sought to
   advance. The competition shone a spotlight on problems with focus, tone,
   and especially scale when it came to the `life-size' direct portrait,
   and it managed to promote the role of subjectivity and the superiority
   of enlargement instead of its preferred ends.},

Title = {The Iwirakau Project: A Collaborative Waiapu Approach},
Journal = {HISTORY OF PHOTOGRAPHY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {42},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {239-248},
Abstract = {The Iwirakau Project was a collaboration that stretched from urban
   museums to remote rural marae-the meeting grounds constituted of
   buildings centred on carved houses in Maori communities-between a Maori
   writer and a Maori photographer both with tribal connections to Ngati
   Porou Tuturu on the East Coast of Te Ika-a-Maui (North Island) of
   Aotearoa (New Zealand). This area is referred to as Te Riu o Waiapu, the
   Waiapu Valley, named for the ancestral mother river, and home to many
   meeting houses carved by men trained in the Iwirakau tradition between
   1830 and 1930. This article examines the cultural guidance required to
   take the camera on to marae and into carved meeting houses to photograph
   ancestral places. Over the five-year span of working together, new ways
   of understanding Maori spiritual guardianship of images emerged,
   aligning with concepts of photographic sovereignty. In conjunction with
   elders, new tikanga (protocols) for the ethics of photographing, seeking
   permission, publishing, and returning research were developed. Through
   this process, three key Maori values whakapapa (genealogical
   connection), manaakitanga (hospitality), and rangatiratanga
   (sovereignty)-guided the project. In this article, Maori filmmaker Barry
   Barclay's conception of `camera as a friend' displaces Susan Sontag's
   idea of the camera as a weapon, arriving at a new proposition of the
   camera as part of the extended family.},

Title = {The Japanese Photographers of Broome: Photography and Cross-Cultural
   Encounter},
Journal = {HISTORY OF PHOTOGRAPHY},

Volume = {41},

Pages = {3-24},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The remote West Australian town of Broome has a unique photography
   heritage that sheds new light on the complexities of photography and
   intercultural relations. During the early twentieth century thriving
   Japanese communities were established in this region around the
   lucrative pearling industry. These Japanese communities also helped to
   develop a fascinating photography culture in Broome. Photography was not
   simply a business opportunity for the Japanese or a means of documenting
   people and events; it was a medium through which hierarchised social
   relations were produced, redefined, and challenged. This article
   examines photographs by these Japanese residents as an important site of
   cross-cultural communication and interpretation. These photographs of
   Anglo-Australian, Japanese, and Aboriginal residents of Broome enrich
   the study of cross-cultural photographic encounters, and emphasise the
   dynamic and dispersed qualities of Australian photographic practice and
   history. Here national histories of photography are usefully
   conceptualised as the products of imbricated social, economic, and
   cultural relations that operate across regional, national, and
   international realms.},

Pages = {141-158},
Abstract = {This article analyses Henry Peach Robinson's method of making composite
   photographs in the context of widespread belief that the photographer's
   `mechanism' was perceptible in the appearance of his prints. By
   examining Robinson's preparatory and darkroom procedures, as well as the
   photographer's extensive writing about his photographic practice, I
   suggest that composite photographs invited viewers to pay attention to
   process, and to take it into account in their evaluation of an image.
   This attitude challenged key tenets of academic art theory - the
   paradigm for nascent concepts of art in photography - by refusing to
   subordinate manual labour to that of the mind. While many
   nineteenth-century critics rejected Robinson's approach, the debates
   engendered by composite techniques reveal a persistent fascination with
   making that advanced photographic practice as a marker of artistic
   value.},

Abstract = {This article analyses a representative selection of photographs from the
   Archivo General de la Nacion Argentina produced by an army of
   photographers who assiduously chronicled Eva and Juan Domingo Peron's
   public engagements. These images were shrewdly informed by an array of
   popular forms (tango lyrics, the storylines of photo-romances, movies,
   and radio serials), and by a set of visual models borrowed from the
   nineteenth-century photography tradition, commercial photography studios
   of celebrities, Hollywood fashion codes, Soviet-related paradigms
   anchored in the legacy of the socialist and anarchist movements of early
   twentieth-century Argentina, and from royal and religious iconography.
   Through their careful staging before the camera, Peron and Eva
   amalgamated these visual traditions with their political content in
   order to reach and unify the multiple socio-political constituencies of
   Argentina at the time. The conventional aesthetic - in terms of view
   angles, lighting, and composition - of such images granted their
   movement a patina of legitimacy and the sense of an enduring legacy.},

Abstract = {The artistic imagination of Sugimoto Hiroshi revolves around images of
   the oceanic intended, in their presentation of flat, open, and tranquil
   calm, to counter the forces of modernity and restore a sense of the
   religious in the profane. Sugimoto's oceanic vision, however, also draws
   upon elements of a politically regressive ideology that marked Japanese
   cultural productions in the 1930s which bound the hope of restoration to
   an aesthetics of death and repose. In this article, I illustrate how
   Sugimoto's oceanic vision disturbs this ideology even as it invokes the
   visual and rhetorical structures that marked its forms.},

Abstract = {Across three decades at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA),
   curator Sandra S. Phillips (American, born 1945) built a distinctive
   photography collection and exhibition programme driven by her
   institution's geographical setting. In response to Phillips's oral
   history excerpt for the project Framing the Field, this article
   identifies intuition as an emphasis of Phillips's interview and her
   curatorial practice. Challenging the perception of intuition as
   irreconcilable with traditional scholarly expertise, this article
   examines it as a form of knowledge and core component of ideation.
   Combined with her art historical acumen, Phillips's stance of
   receptivity towards SFMOMA's location in the Bay Area, California, the
   western USA and the greater Pacific Rim propelled her shaping of the
   institution's photography programme. Ultimately, her example indicates
   how intuition and expertise are mutually constitutive and intertwined.},

Abstract = {Framing photography and policing through Michael Foucault's concept of
   counter-conducts in his writings on governmentality, this article
   discusses photography's provocations within colonial governmentality of
   the Irish insurgent movements of the mid nineteenth century. In 1866,
   British authorities legislated for suspension of habeas corpus in
   response to what they identified as the Fenian threat to the ideals of
   the modern liberal state. Fenian insurgency was not just an
   anti-colonial movement but an asymmetrical political fraternity with a
   trans-Atlantic membership that included retired American Civil War
   veterans. Mobilised for the identification and surveillance of Fenians
   traversing across the Atlantic and the Irish Sea, photography was used
   to arrest the likenesses of individuals whose mobility threatened the
   security of the state and its colonies. In this process, the
   photograph's mass reproducibility and mobility as a material
   image-object was pressed into action to identify suspected insurgents.
   Exploring the entwined histories of photography, policing and the Fenian
   Irish, the article discusses how photography simultaneously contributed
   to and undermined colonial governmentality.},

Abstract = {Intended to promote the success of rapid industrialisation, especially
   at the time of the first Five-Year Plan (1928-32), Soviet photography
   was disseminated to other countries through the networks of the
   Communist International. The circulation of Soviet photographs in the
   press helped define a specifically communist visual culture,
   characterised by idiosyncratic visual tropes and graphic treatment of
   images through photomontage and dynamic page layout. This article
   highlights the role of graphic designers and illustrators in the
   development of political photomontage in France, particularly through
   periodicals associated with the Communist Party such as Regards and the
   Almanach ouvrier et paysan. These illustrated publications often
   borrowed their iconography and innovative page layout directly from
   Soviet magazines such as USSR in Construction. By showing how images
   have been appropriated and transformed, I suggest that communist editors
   in the early 1930s encouraged a type of militant participation that
   challenged individual authorship.},

Journal = {HISTORY OF PHOTOGRAPHY},

Volume = {42},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {288-305},
Abstract = {When Lore and History of the South Island Maori was published in 1952 it
   filled a vacuum in terms of accessible Ngai Tahu history in the public
   domain. Despite its scholarly shortcomings, it remained one of the only
   readily available texts on Ngai Tahu history for another thirty years. A
   major element of the publication was its inclusion of photographs, all
   taken by the author, William Anderson Taylor. Using the Ngai Tahu
   portraits in Lore and History as a starting point, and informed where
   possible by oral interviews with their descendants, this article
   introduces some of the tribal members who were Taylor's informants,
   friends, and photographic subjects. Through a reading of the
   photographs, the article will briefly trace the trajectory of Taylor's
   relationship with Ngai Tahu and consider how the visual stories
   illuminate the text of Lore and History and Taylor's wider body of work
   with the iwi (tribe) in the first half of the twentieth century. While
   Taylor is best known as an amateur historian and ethnographer, his
   photographic practice was also fundamental to his ethnographic research.
   The photographic contracts that Taylor entered into with the Ngai Tahu
   subjects of his photographs created an environment that facilitated
   exchange, rapport, empathy, and, frequently, enduring bonds.},

Abstract = {Henri Cartier-Bresson's photobook The Decisive Moment (1952) popularised
   the notion that the best photographs are made by the patient and gifted
   photographer who captures a fleeting moment with just one click of the
   shutter, creating an image with internal geometry and balance. The book
   solidified Cartier-Bresson's reputation as an artist working with a
   camera and it encouraged scholars, curators, and hobbyists to understand
   photography as the product of trained individual vision and talent. Yet
   the book's emphasis on personal vision also deflected attention away
   from the collective efforts and infrastructure necessary to promote
   Cartier-Bresson's practice as art. By shifting our attention to the
   decisive network of magazine editors, book publishers, printers, and
   curators who helped Cartier-Bresson onto a highly orchestrated road to
   fame at mid-century, this article considers the ways in which collective
   work is central to the material and social history of photography, and
   how these realities challenge the decisive moment's paradigm of
   individual and inspired creation.},

Abstract = {This article examines nineteenth-century photographs of the
   archaeological site of Magnesia on the Meander, focusing on the work of
   Alexander Svoboda in the 1860s and that of a German archaeological team
   who excavated there in the 1890s. While a brief archaeological campaign
   was undertaken at Magnesia in the 1840s, by the 1860s, when Svoboda took
   his photograph, the site was abandoned and unstudied. Through an
   investigation of both the career of Svoboda and the history of
   archaeological photography in the region, this article places Svoboda's
   photography in the larger context of investigation at Magnesia. It
   argues that Svoboda's photograph of Magnesia was part of his most
   important project, a book of photographs and an accompanying exhibition
   on the Seven Churches of Asia. Svoboda's inclusion of Magnesia within
   this project exposed the site to a much larger audience, and influenced
   how the site was viewed and understood. This photograph, therefore,
   represents a turning point in the history of this site, leading to the
   eventual recovery and study of this important classical city under the
   German excavators, and their own photographic recording of the city's
   classical ruins.},
