Abstract = {Edouard Baldus, a prominent figure in the history of French photography,
   is known almost exclusively for his silver-based photographs of the
   1850s and early 1860s. Yet Baldus was also at the forefront of
   developments in photomechanical reproduction, publishing seven albums of
   photogravure prints between 1866 and 1884. Palais du Louvre et des
   Tuileries. Motifs de decorations, published in various editions between
   1869 and 1875, was the first to reproduce his own photographs rather
   than engravings by earlier artists. It depicts architectural elements of
   the Louvre and Tuileries palaces, images that derive largely from
   Baldus's commission between 1855 and 1857 to document the construction
   of the New Louvre. Drawing from analyses of Palais's prints and their
   corresponding photographs, this article examines Baldus's photogravure
   process and his strategies as an editor and publisher of his own work.
   It furthermore demonstrates that he chose to illustrate Palais with
   photogravures rather than photographs for specific aesthetic and
   conceptual reasons in addition to concerns about economy and the
   stability of silver-based prints. Lastly, this article argues for the
   significance of Baldus's photogravure production to his entire oeuvre
   and to the development of photomechanical processes in the
   mid-nineteenth century.},

Abstract = {Hariot Lady Dufferin (1843-1936) accompanied her husband to India during
   his Viceregency (1884-1888). While there she took up photography as a
   leisure activity in order to capture for posterity views of a country
   she greatly admired. This essay examines, from a post-colonial
   perspective, her private collection of photographs, encompassing
   landscapes, people, imperial acquisitions and more personal spaces.
   Using a Foucaultian argument, it considers how these photographs help to
   define the Vicereine's subject position, as an upper-class woman at the
   very centre of British rule in India, who was both surveyor and
   surveyed: she was privileged, yet, owing to the confines of gender,
   unable to express in written form any views on the affairs of state.
   Photography, however, offered her a useful visual language through which
   she could engage with the discourses of empire.},

Journal = {HISTORY OF PHOTOGRAPHY},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {33},
Number = {3},
Pages = {237-248},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Hannah Maynard's experimental works continue to defy classification, for
   critics have tended to explain them as either the product of an
   eccentric personality or as a surrealist aberration. This article gives
   particular attention to the latter claim, exploring Maynard's
   relationship to the modernist movement more generally through comparison
   with Hannah Hoch, who is known as a practitioner of Dadaist
   photomontage. While the contents of their oeuvres place Maynard and Hoch
   within their respective historical milieus, the two artists passed
   through similar developments and demonstrated uncanny parallels in their
   technique and approach to artistic production. Maynard and Hoch flaunted
   social convention in their lives and work, using modernist tools to
   critique norms of domesticity and to explore notions of self. With one
   foot in a Victorian world of spirit, memorialization, and interior
   imagery and the other applying increasing levels of structure,
   juxtaposition, perspective and irony to problems of individual identity,
   Maynard is best viewed as an intermediary between nineteenth-century
   sensibilities and a more modern world view.},

Title = {Lee Miller's Revenge on Fascist Culture},
Journal = {HISTORY OF PHOTOGRAPHY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {36},
Number = {4},
Pages = {397-413},
Abstract = {A significant part of Lee Miller's photographic work of 1945 focuses on
   Nazi environments. This paper argues that in these photographs Miller
   composed images that destabilised Nazi iconographies and explored the
   breakdown of Nazi aesthetic representations. Focusing on two of her
   photographs from this period - Suicided Staff Officer of the
   Burgermeister, Town Hall, Leipzig and Suicides in the Town Hall, Leipzig
   - the essay explores how these photographs constituted interventions
   into Nazism's discursive and ideological positioning of art and
   representation, analysing them in relation to fashion, advertising, and
   dada and surrealist traditions. By contrasting Miller's pictures with
   photographs of the same scenes by Margaret Bourke-White and J. Malan
   Heslop, the paper argues that Miller's images offer composed scenes
   rather than straightforward documentation and involve the viewer in a
   philosophical, analytical and artistic discourse that destabilises and
   opposes the assertion by fascist and other oppressive ideologies that
   the link between representation and reality is flawless and natural.
   Miller's photographs from 1945 offer a complex response to these
   aesthetic tools and to art, including photography, and its roles in the
   wider ideological emphasis on representation in the fascist
   Weltanschauung. This presents a world that is evident in Nazism's
   staging of its ideologically motivated exhibitions, the Grosse Deutsche
   Kunstausstellung (The Great German Art Exhibition) and Entartete Kunst
   (Degenerate Art), which attempted to demolish and deem `degenerate' work
   by modern artists including a number of Miller's friends such as Picasso
   and Max Ernst. Miller adopts dada and surrealist discourses, allusions
   and aesthetic strategies to support the avant-garde aesthetics National
   Socialism sought to destroy.},

Abstract = {By way of a dialogue between the two authors-an artist and an art
   historian-this article reflects on the artistic method of repurposing
   the colonial archive, in particular the vast collection of photographs
   of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. Important contexts for
   this work include the international practice, established in the 1990s
   amongst artists, communities, and museums, of addressing hidden
   histories of war and genocide in the public sphere. In Australia, this
   included challenging colonial visions and the damaging history of
   representing First Nations peoples. At the same time, Australian
   colonial archives increasingly became more accessible and an important
   cultural and political resource for First Nations peoples. This article
   considers both the debate around cultural protocols of Indigenous
   knowledge that has emerged in the last twenty years and the relentless
   ideology of primitivism that has restricted the visibility of Indigenous
   loss. Pervading these developments has been the persistent emotional,
   historical, and political dilemma of how artists access these archives
   and produce decolonial readings of the ` mess' and trauma of colonial
   events.},

Abstract = {This article presents Gardner's Photographic Sketch Book of the War
   (1866) as Alexander Gardner's manifesto on the possibilities of the
   photograph. Although Walt Whitman famously maintained that the true
   story of the US Civil War could never be told, the Sketch Book suggests
   otherwise. Throughout the work, Gardner implicitly presented the
   photographic image as a form of relic, one that did not simultaneously
   destroy and disperse the site it portrayed. Its presentation of
   seemingly unmediated fact was intended to anchor the book's descriptions
   and imbue the writing with the imprimatur of truth. Presented as a
   natural emanation of war-rent sites, the photograph could allow for
   historical dissemination without decimation.},

Abstract = {In this article, we animate the interstitial practices shared by
   photojournalists and police officers, and sketch some of the stakes for
   visual practitioners `bearing witness while black'. We employ visual
   analyses of protest images by Black photographers while tracing the
   specific visual techniques of oversight mobilised by law enforcement.
   These include police departments' co-optation of news images to identify
   and criminalise racial justice protesters alongside efforts to
   professionalise police officers into photographers. We theorise the
   anti-Black intersections shared across these expansive formations -
   policing and photojournalism - in an effort to account for the ways in
   which both systems maintain and invest in damaging visualities that
   shape consequences `on the ground' for Black and brown communities.},

   Photonovel},
Journal = {HISTORY OF PHOTOGRAPHY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {42},
Number = {4},
Pages = {392-404},
Abstract = {The issue of the preservation of photographic heritage involves much
   more than vintage prints. Other unoriginal prints - that is, images we
   only know as reprints of (lost) original prints - are also a matter of
   concern, and the film photonovel may help raise significant issues in
   this regard that would otherwise risk being overlooked. At first sight,
   the specific medium of the film photonovel - that is, the reissue in
   photonovel format of original movies, a cultural practice that was
   extremely popular in the second half of the 1950s and the beginning of
   the 1960s - raises all of the questions that arise when discussing the
   materiality of photographic archives: issues of material fragility and
   decay, authorship and authenticity, and completeness and value. At the
   same time, the utterly uncanonical status of this corpus, sometimes
   described as the lumpen' version of what is generally considered an
   illegitimate genre, provides an opportunity to ask different kinds of
   questions with regard to the very definition of key notions such as
   photography, photographic record, and photographic archive. In this
   sense, the film photonovel opens a range of questions that continue -
   yet in a very different direction - Rosalind Krauss's provocative
   question on the discursive spaces of photography.},

Abstract = {This article studies the often-despised genre of the photo-novel from a
   wide range of points of view: historical, cultural, narratological. The
   photo-novel appears as a genre whose first examples were seen both as an
   absolute novelty and as a terrible anachronism, and the entire history
   of the genre is interpreted in light of the attempt to cope with this
   difficulty. In this process, the twin notions of self-irony and parody
   play a crucial role, as is demonstrated by the early fictional
   dramatisation of the medium in Fellini's The White Sheik.},

Title = {Hybridity: The reverse of photographic medium specificity?},
Journal = {HISTORY OF PHOTOGRAPHY},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {31},
Number = {1},
Pages = {3-10},
Month = {SPR},
Abstract = {In medium theory-and, since nobody doubts that photography is a medium,
   the same will apply in the photographic field - notions of hybridity and
   medium-specificity are always closely intertwined, as if they were the
   obverse and reverse of the same coin. The very belief that media are
   `medium specific', whatever this medium specificity may entail, opens
   the logical possibility of a combination, a blending or even a blurring
   of media, whereas the analogous conviction that media can never be
   limited to their specificity raises, no less logically, a set of
   questions on that impossible to define, yet always returning, issue of
   specificity. Following the theoretical preferences-and prejudices-of
   each theoretician, specificity and hybridity are defined in very
   different ways. Hybridity as a combination of media that are specific,
   for instance, is not to be equated with hybridity as the result of a
   crossing (in the almost biological sense of the term). The same goes for
   specificity as a quasi-Platonic essence, or, on the contrary, as the
   permanent reinvention of what it might mean to `be' a medium. In this
   article, we will try to rethink a number of these very general but
   inescapable questions in the context of the field of photography. The
   study ends with a short presentation of the work of Henri Van Lier, a
   Belgian semiotician whose ideas offer a good illustration of the theses
   defended in these pages.},

Abstract = {This article explores how Claude Cation (1894-1954) interrogated vision
   in her photographs as a means of control and categorization of the
   `other', particularly in relation to sexological and psychoanalytic
   discourses. In the sustained project of self-invention that Cahun
   undertook with her lifelong lover and stepsister, Marcel Moore
   (1892-1972), her key strategies are parody and the ironic reversal of
   dominant representations of gender, sexuality and race. These strategies
   are examined firstly in Cahun's mimicry of the portraits of paternal
   `others' and then through analysis of the strategic deployment, veiling
   and flaunting in her images of her Jewish and `third sex' identity, her
   real life performances, her writings and her objects.},

Volume = {40},
Number = {2},
Pages = {146-166},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Henri Cartier-Bresson's photobook The Decisive Moment (1952) popularised
   the notion that the best photographs are made by the patient and gifted
   photographer who captures a fleeting moment with just one click of the
   shutter, creating an image with internal geometry and balance. The book
   solidified Cartier-Bresson's reputation as an artist working with a
   camera and it encouraged scholars, curators, and hobbyists to understand
   photography as the product of trained individual vision and talent. Yet
   the book's emphasis on personal vision also deflected attention away
   from the collective efforts and infrastructure necessary to promote
   Cartier-Bresson's practice as art. By shifting our attention to the
   decisive network of magazine editors, book publishers, printers, and
   curators who helped Cartier-Bresson onto a highly orchestrated road to
   fame at mid-century, this article considers the ways in which collective
   work is central to the material and social history of photography, and
   how these realities challenge the decisive moment's paradigm of
   individual and inspired creation.},

Abstract = {This essay explores key historical and theoretical concerns in the
   photographic history of Senegal. Drawing on interviews carried out
   during visits to Saint-Louis and Dakar (in 2007-2008), it documents the
   polyvalent practices of photographers working in Senegal in the mid-20th
   century, with a focus on the career and collections of El Hadj Adama
   Sylla, a photographer active in Saint-Louis from the 1950s and the
   former curator of the photographic collections of the Centre de
   Recherches et de Documentation du Senegal (CRDS). Sylla was also a
   formidable private collector, and, in the first part of the essay, I
   examine the complex relationships between these official and personal
   collections, and I explore the broader consequences of polyvalent
   practice for the constitution of collections, definition of genres, and
   for our broader understanding of the role played by photography in the
   development of the political imagination of the postcolonial state. In
   the second part of the essay, I examine the extension of photography, in
   the period immediately following independence, into new domains of
   political imagination, and its role in the production of both `official'
   and unofficial or non-state investments in the political iconography of
   the postcolonial state.},

Abstract = {Stereoscopy initiated a dimensional shift that freed representation from
   the laws of geometric optics and longstanding conventions of linear
   perspective, creating aesthetic possibilities that were first explored
   by now obscure stereo-photographers. The late nineteenth-century rupture
   in the pictorial order' that Hubert Damisch attributes to Paul Cezanne
   has a genealogy that includes stereoscopy, the debates about binocular
   space perception that it occasioned, as well as innovative photographic
   work for the stereoscope. Through reading Hippolyte Taine, Cezanne was
   aware of the Berkelean idea that binocular space is not seen, but rather
   assembled from visual and tactile sensation sampled across time. The
   problem that this understanding posed for representation led many to
   insist that binocular space could only be invoked through synthetic
   apparatuses like the stereoscope; others argued for new conventions of
   planar representation, or binocular painting'. The visual evidence from
   Cezanne's work suggests that he paid attention to prescriptions for
   binocular painting and also to the new pictorial language developed by
   stereo photographers. Stereo photographers in the 1850s and 1860s, by
   abandoning perspectival conventions and proposing a constructivist
   conception of space, helped to transform Western visual culture in
   hitherto unappreciated ways.},

Abstract = {In this essay I argue that the diverse archive of stereoscopic imagery
   has not so far been properly read historically - that is, in relation to
   its material and discursive context. The early-nineteenth-century
   context was characterised by multiple positions in debate which can be
   used to make sense of three broad projects of stereoscopic
   representation. The first, naive realist project was to subsume
   stereoscopy under geometric optics and to claim for it verisimilitude to
   the thing represented, and in the process leave unchallenged the
   conventions of perspective painting as a model of how we actually see.
   The second was to embrace the stereoscope's contribution to a
   long-standing critique of the anomalies of binocular `natural vision'
   and to explore a new pictorial logic of geometrically impossible objects
   in geometrically monstrous space - an aesthetic that I begin here to
   document. This was not so much a project of `realism' as of
   verisimilitude to a radically transformed conception of natural vision -
   one that had already begun and would continue to undermine the `truth'
   of perspective convention. The third project was anti-realist, inspired
   by evidence that spatial perception was not determined by external
   stimulus but rather constructed through the intervention of a sometimes
   capricious spatial imagination.},

Abstract = {One of the most ambitious photographic projects the world has ever seen
   was announced at the 1887 International Astronomical Conference. Known
   as the Carte du Ciel' or `Mapping the Stars' project, its grand aim was
   to record on photographic plates the stars in the night sky. Worked on
   by eighteen observatories around the world, it was estimated that it
   would require 22,154 photographic plates. Although little known today,
   this project cemented the role of photography as a tool for astronomers
   and was in particular a major accomplishment for the Sydney Observatory,
   where it was worked on for over seventy years.},

Abstract = {This study focuses on the photographs that first brought Berenice Abbott
   critical acclaim: her Paris portraits from the late 1920s. As a body of
   work, these images - along with what Abbott had to say about them and
   the critical attention they generated at the time - provide a rich
   resource for the study of three interconnected topics: the avant-garde
   critical climate of Europe in the late 1920s, the American expatriate
   experience in Paris during this same time and Abbott's nascent
   photographic values and aesthetic, which helped to inform not only her
   portraits but also her later, better-known photographs of New York City.
   The paper first defines the divergent critical responses to Abbott's
   portrait work in the late 1920s - focusing especially on the published
   criticism by Florent Fels and Pierre Mac Orlan that helped to secure
   Abbott's international reputation as a leading modern photographer. It
   then turns to Abbott's expatriate experience in order to examine the
   ideas and individuals that she identified as most important to her
   photographic practice. Specifically the paper explains Abbott's desire
   to create an alternative approach to photography from the one used by
   Man Ray, her awareness of the classical style associated with Pablo
   Picasso and her admiration for the aesthetic theories of Leo Stein.},

Abstract = {A New York photojournalist who specialised in scenes of crime and
   disaster, Weegee also made photographs reflecting his Jewish heritage,
   among them being pictures focusing upon assimilation, social justice and
   anti-Semitism. By discussing a number of such photographs, many of them
   published in Weegee's first books, Naked City (1945) and Weegee's People
   (1946), this article describes how the photographer's religiocultural
   inheritance influenced his imagery. At the same time, the article
   provides a model for future analyses of how Jewish descent affected the
   work of other influential Jewish-American photographers.},

Abstract = {This article examines the circulation of a series of photographs taken
   by Frances Benjamin Johnston at the Hampton Normal and Agricultural
   Institute in Hampton, Virginia, in 1899. It looks first at their display
   in the context of the American Negro Exhibit at the Paris Exposition of
   1900; second, it considers an exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art,
   New York in 1966; and third, it discusses an exhibit at the Williams
   College Museum of Art in 2000 in which the Hampton photographs were
   paired with work by contemporary artist, Carrie Mae Weems. The article
   analyzes the context and the display techniques of each exhibition in
   order to show how the function of the photographs shifted from public
   relations material to art. In tracing this shift, the article
   demonstrates that the meaning of the photographs is not fixed; rather,
   it was constituted through different discursive frameworks.},

   England-based photographer Antoine Claudet, beginning in 1842 and

   these photographs, because of the technical innovations they represent
   but also due to their conceptual sophistication. In many of these works,
   Claudet turned looking at photographic images into a self-reflexive
   activity, into an activity overtly dependent on a productive interaction

Abstract = {The history of photography has generally been conceived of in terms of
   technical advances, aesthetics, genre or oeuvre. This article proposes
   that other histories become apparent when materiality is foregrounded.
   To support this proposition the study focuses primarily on one portrait
   photograph and its embedded history, which is evident in its shifts in
   material form. The photograph under consideration is of Cornelius, more
   familiarly known as Con Colbert, a minor figure in the Irish Rising of
   1916. His memory came to exceed the life of a man, and to understand why
   this was the case it is necessary to focus on the mediated presence of
   his portrait image in a culture of remembrance. What Colbert's portrait
   makes evident is that a photograph is a material object which carries a
   history in its transferences, display formats and layered meanings.
   Photographs do things, they have agency, are affective and, in turn, are
   effected by cultural needs and interpretation. In other words, it is
   proposed that a history of the photograph is embedded in the exchanges
   and uses to which it is put which cannot be separated out from choices
   of material form.},

Abstract = {This essay is both a study of Irish photography and an inquiry into how
   we narrate the past. It begins from the premise that the photograph is
   always caught between history and memory. In this relationship, the
   archive has come to assume major significance both as a material space
   and as an electronic site of supposedly no space. The case study offered
   is based on the Larcom Albums of 1857 and 1866, which contain the
   earliest prison photography in Ireland and Britain, and which are now
   freely available to view at the Digital Gallery of the New York Public
   Library. This study focuses on these Albums as material artefacts and
   the significance of their migration. From there, attention is placed on
   the narratives now being applied to these photographs through their
   visual presence on the Internet. The findings posit that even as digital
   surrogates, shadows of the images' past persist. Digitisation offers the
   potential for millions of people to see a vastly enlarged number of old
   photographs. What this study reveals is that the endless array of
   apparently free-floating images is still contained by cultural needs and
   the narratives to which they can be put.},

Abstract = {This essay considers the significance of the Foucaultian notion of
   surveillance in accounts of the history of photography, raising the
   question whether Ireland's colonial placement during the nineteenth
   century led to a different history of the medium. The Study focuses on
   Irish Special Branch's adoption of secret photography during the latter
   part of the nineteenth century in order to determine why this type of
   photography was considered useful. It also pays attention to the types
   of photographs collected by the Branch. The writer situates Special
   Branch's adoption of secret photography within a visual economy in
   Ireland where an alternative type of imagery (commercially produced
   eviction photographs) was employed to construct a different register for
   what constituted legitimacy and lawlessness. In addition, emphasis is
   placed oil the role of photography in Ireland within a larger discursive
   framework of colonial policy making. Visibility is crucial to the
   Foucaultian model, and the failure to embed such signs in both the
   photographs produced and collected by Special Branch indicates that it
   was possible to produce lacunae in the power/knowledge paradigm. The
   writer concludes that the history of the deployment of secret
   photography in Ireland reveals how it failed to produce the required
   Visual signs needed to win consent for control.},

Pages = {126-140},
Abstract = {A key dimension of photomontage is the way that its formal features -
   and consequent debates about the probity of making a photograph out of
   multiple sources - illuminate some of the fundamental problems of
   representation in the late nineteenth century. Among these was the
   question of whether an account of the past was properly presented as an
   unmediated transmission of fact, or demonstrably fashioned by an author:
   whether the tools of representation were to be submerged or emphasised.
   This article examines the parallels between the strategies of authorial
   visibility in early photomontage and the rhetorical approaches adopted
   by historians to modulate their presence in their texts. In particular,
   this study investigates the convergences of historiography and
   photomontage around the collapse of the Second Empire, a moment that
   witnessed powerful shifts in the conception of the voice of the
   historian as well as the production of photomontages that grappled with
   - and even thematised - the problem of their constructedness. An
   important but little-known group of photomontages by Eugene Appert,
   depicting the Imperial family in exile as well as the emerging Third
   Republic from which they fled, registers these conjunctions in their
   full complexity.},

Journal = {HISTORY OF PHOTOGRAPHY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {42},

Pages = {338-355},
Abstract = {In 1859, Reverend Alexander Keith published the thirty-seventh edition
   of his Evidence of the Truth of the Christian Religion Derived from the
   Literal Fulfilment of Prophecy; Particularly as Illustrated by the
   History of the Jews and by the Discoveries of Recent Travellers.
   Included in the illustrations were eighteen engravings from
   daguerreotypes, presenting the landscape of Palestine and Syria in order
   to demonstrate the fulfilment of Old Testament prophecies regarding its
   desolation. In this article, Keith's use of photographic reference is
   presented as it relates to the illustration of specific biblical texts
   and to his evangelical characterisation of the camera's empirical point
   of view. Keith's notion of photographic truth, while grounded in the
   mid-nineteenth-century's conceptualisation of the medium's indexical
   science, is revealed through his theology of the literary landscape, his
   telescoped teleology, and the more than human' capacity of the lens. The
   author argues that with the interdisciplinary engagement of biblical
   studies a deeper critical understanding of such an explicitly
   confessional position attributes greater complexity and specificity to
   the role of religious ideology in shaping early Holy Land photography.},

Abstract = {This essay offers a network theory of early photography of the Middle
   East. Drawing on Bruno Latour's elaboration of actor-network theory in
   Reassembling the Social (2005), it focuses on John Cramb's 1860
   photographs of Jerusalem, Maxime Du Camp's 1849-50 photographs of Egypt,
   and Auguste Salzmann's 1854 photographs of Jerusalem to critique art
   historical approaches that view these images solely in terms of their
   aesthetic values or documentary significance. What is slighted in such
   approaches, it argues, is the orientalist network that undergirds the
   works of these photographers. This essay discusses the overdetermined
   production of early photography of the Middle East to demonstrate that
   the large archive of early photographs of the region are inscribed
   within a complex web of actors, practices, institutions, as well as
   cultural, economic, and political relations between the West and the
   so-called `Orient', a network that provided the logistical means and the
   conceptual paradigms for the production and consumption of these images.},

Abstract = {The visual culture of the female nude in Western art, after decades of
   attention, possesses a considerable genealogy of critical scholarship.
   The photographic imagery of women's bodies occupies a significant place
   in this legacy, yet there are areas of inquiry that have to date
   remained little examined. In this article I consider a small and
   eccentric group of images, made by commercial photographers for popular
   consumption, posed by the American socialite Clara Ward around the turn
   of the twentieth century, as a case study of faux nudes - studio
   photographs in which models were encased in semitransparent body
   stockings, thus generalising, protecting and idealising the female body
   in its representation. If nudity is - ideally - an absolute state, it is
   nevertheless culturally complex in its various guises. The faux nudity
   constructed in these glamorous photographs was an invention of modern
   technology made possible by advances in commercial textile production as
   well as photography, as the stockinet body stocking provided a fiction
   of marmoreal whiteness further enhanced by being rendered in monochrome,
   and then widely distributed through cabinet prints and postcards. Around
   1900 such artefacts further mystified the woman's body in visual
   culture, producing a fantasy woman for modern times.},

Journal = {HISTORY OF PHOTOGRAPHY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {41},
Number = {3},
Pages = {217-240},
Abstract = {Leopold Szondi invented a projective test using photographs of people
   with mental pathologies to determine the unconscious, ancestral
   illnesses (or aptitudes) of his subjects. Szondi's images were garnered
   from psychiatric textbooks published around 1900. Such photographs
   presumably revealed unconscious thoughts, desires, and destinies in the
   course of a test session. If a patient responded positively to a
   photo-portrait of a diagnosed hysteric', for instance, this indicated
   that the subject herself had unconscious, inherited hysterical traits.
   Szondi's reasoning was predicated upon two commonly held fallacies:
   first that an individual's physical appearance is the external marker of
   mental life, and second that photography is a transparent means of
   revealing true facts. In spite of (or maybe even because of) such
   problematic assumptions, Szondi's use of photographs can be located
   historically in a tradition of reading human character from portraiture.
   The test was widespread, and was even administered to Adolf Eichmann at
   the time of his trial in Jerusalem - an ironic cultural development as
   Szondi himself would have been among the thousands of Jews deported from
   Hungary directly to Auschwitz by Eichmann had the Szondi family not been
   rescued by the Kastner train of 1944.},

Volume = {36},

Pages = {326-336},
Abstract = {This article examines `Lost to Worlds' (2008), a series of thirty
   photographs by the contemporary Australian artist Anne Ferran. The
   series depicts a historically significant site where there is almost
   nothing left to see. All that remains of the former nineteenth-century
   female factory are minor marks in the earth. By showing the viewer
   almost nothing, `Lost to Worlds' raises a number of questions about what
   can be known or communicated about the past by photography. In
   particular, the traditional understanding of photographic witnessing is
   transformed by Ferran's subtle evocation of the history of a site by
   images of emptiness. The article considers the recent rise of scholarly
   interest in the idea of witnessing and how Ferran's series can provoke a

Abstract = {Although many in the field of Indian photography are aware of the
   photographs John Edward Sache produced in India, little has been written
   about his career. Almost nothing was known about this practitioner,
   whose biographical details were confused with various firms - Sache
   Westfield, Sache Murray, Sache Lawrie and Sache Co. - and with various
   other names - J. Sache and A. Sache - appearing on photographs or in
   trade directories. Sache followed the steps of the well-known English
   photographer Samuel Bourne, who had set up a paradigm for composing
   landscape and architectural views, in which the picturesque vocabulary
   dominated. A master of the Picturesque, Sache excelled in this style,
   offering astonishing views that have often been attributed to Bourne.
   This essay will present the photographic career of Sache and compare the
   work of both practitioners in order to delineate the extents to which
   Sache reproduced Bourne's formula.},

Abstract = {This article explores the intersection between policing and photography
   in the course of the Civil Disobedience Movement in colonial Bombay in
   1930-31 by focusing on historical photographs compiled in a recently
   discovered album. When the `disobedient' men, women and children of
   Bombay repeatedly challenged the colonial state by breaking laws deemed
   unjust under the leadership of Mohandas K. Gandhi, they came into direct
   confrontation with the most visible expression of imperial authority:
   the cross-racial Bombay Police armed with the ubiquitous baton (lathi).
   While Indian historiography is particularly rich in its exploration of
   both exceptional and quotidian forms of colonial violence, the visual
   history of violent policing remains underexplored. Through our analysis
   of photographic images from two specific episodes of the disobedient
   drama that unfolded in Bombay in 1930 - the raids at the salt pans in
   Wadala in June, and the national flag salutation ceremony at the
   Esplanade in October - we explore the complex and conspicuous
   entanglement of race and gender in a moment of heightened anti-colonial
   action and police violence in British India. In underscoring the work of
   the camera in documenting the history of violent police action against
   non-violent civil demonstrators, we reveal its role as a historical
   actor and an active participant in history-making.},

Title = {A Synthesis of Nature and Abstraction: Unearthing Robert Smithson's
   Minimalist Theory of Photography},
Journal = {HISTORY OF PHOTOGRAPHY},
Year = {2020},

Number = {2-3},
Pages = {192-213},
Month = {JUL 2},
Abstract = {Robert Smithson's photography is commonly associated with conceptual art
   and its watershed critique of the apparatus's documentary mode. On this
   basis, interpreters like Douglas Crimp, Craig Owens and Jeff Wall have
   all positioned Smithson as a key precedent to the expanded field of
   lens-based practice, keyed to the complex concept of the `picture' that
   emerged following the artist's death in 1973. However, a careful review
   of the artist's work and writing reveals that his implicit theory of
   photography could also be meaningfully described as Minimalist - attuned
   to this quasi-sculptural movement's concerns with the clarification and
   renewal of spatiotemporal perception. Smithson's 1969 travelogue,
   `Incidents of Mirror - Travel in the Yucatan', for instance, sets up a
   number of pointed equivalences between photography, Minimalist sculpture
   and select ancient Mesoamerican ritual objects designed - according to
   Smithson's understanding - to expand perception onto new planes of space
   and time. In recent years, scholars such as Walter Benn Michaels have
   advanced the idea that Minimalism's problematics offer key insight into
   late twentiet - century photography's foremost questions regarding the
   nature of this technology and its presence effects, in particular those
   that have long been associated with its indexicality. As this article
   demonstrates, Smithson's camera work engaged meaningfully with these
   same problematics, evincing a decidedly materialist yet radically
   expansive new conception of photographic picturing.},

Abstract = {This article examines the photomontages, photo-sculptures,
   installations, and videos of contemporary artist Sheida Soleimani in
   light of earlier Dadaist practices. In particular, it focuses on
   similarities and differences between Soleimani's work and that of Dada
   artists John Heartfield, Hannah Hoch, and the Baroness Elsa von
   Freytag-Loringhoven, demonstrating how Soleimani has evolved Dada
   photomontage and performance strategies in novel and important ways.
   Soleimani's development of earlier avant-garde strategies with the help
   of digital technologies, I argue, proves the continuing relevance of
   photomontage today. In addition, it also reveals Soleimani's interest in
   combining a Dadaist approach to photography, which - through
   photomontage - emphasizes the artist's position as a social critic and
   commentator on reality, with a Surrealist attitude, one that mobilizes
   the indexical aspects of the photograph to disclose the uncanny and
   mysterious aspects of the world.},

Abstract = {Some historians of photography claim that a radical divide exists
   between analogue and digital photography. At first glance, the analogue
   photographs of Bernd and Hilla Becher, on the one hand, and digital
   works of Andreas Gursky, on the other, would seem to confirm this
   distinction. Closer analysis, however, reveals that the divide between
   analogue and digital practices is not as strong as it initially appears,
   and that truth in photography depends on multiple contingent as well as
   non-contingent factors.},

Abstract = {This article explores the relation between photography and the nation,
   taking the Belgian context as a starting point. Belgian photographies,
   as defined in this essay, have been repeatedly described as exempt from
   schools, centres, towering figures, or strong institutions. Due to this
   absence of positive identity, it is impossible to approach Belgian
   photographies from an essentialist perspective. This essay argues that
   new methodological questions, which generally address photography in its
   multiplicity and its context sensitiveness, are needed for the specific
   study of Belgian photographies. The authors develop such a new set of
   questions by proposing to transfer the notion of `minor literature', as
   theorised by Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari, to the study of
   photography. They end with a close reading of two images by Marcel
   Marien, which they consider a case of minor photography in Belgium in
   the 1950s.},

   search for an all-encompassing love.},

Year = {2008},
Volume = {32},
Number = {1},
Pages = {42-50},
Month = {SPR},
Abstract = {This essay examines how Walker Evans evolved his documentary style in
   response to what he saw as Alfred Stieglitz's overbearing aestheticism.
   It begins with their first meeting and Evans's `rejection' of this
   father-figure, a rejection which became generalised in the history of
   photography on the grounds of a dichotomy between photographic art and
   social documentary. Evans came to represent this latter tendency despite
   his own wishes. With the help of friends like Lincoln Kirstein and
   Bernice Abbott, Evans claimed a different artistic genealogy, via the
   Civil War work of Mathew Brady and his teams and Eugene Atget, neither
   of whom were working in the same vein of documentary as Evans might have
   imagined. He attempted to remain the independent artist, all the while
   taking advantage of his various photographic employments and the
   directions in which they pushed him. In the end, history made him famous
   and influential as the champion of social documentary, a genre which
   coincided neatly with his own desire for a `lyric documentary' for only
   a few years. In his desire to be an artist free from a social agenda, in
   his resistance to branding, he is a maverick bohemian much closer to
   Stieglitz than has been supposed, and he seemed to recognise the fact in
   his last comments on his predecessor.},

   Athenian Antiquity},
Journal = {HISTORY OF PHOTOGRAPHY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {40},
Number = {3},
Pages = {232-249},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {William J. Stillman's 1870 photographic album The Acropolis of Athens
   details, with extraordinary sensitivity, the classical monuments of the
   Athenian Acropolis. But the album itself is part of a larger
   transnational history of the production, representation, and circulation
   of Greek antiquity. It is also a central artefact of Stillman's own life
   and affiliations. Tracing these two interlocking histories is to place
   the album's imagery, narrative, and informational material within the
   larger ambit of individual, national, and Euro-American politics,
   historical ideology and aesthetics. Stillman's album is centrally
   influenced by the German-led archaeological activity on the Acropolis,
   reflecting both its widely-held assumptions on the worth of Greek
   antiquities and the proper way to view them, as well as an ambivalence
   verging on antipathy toward indigenous Greek archaeological (and
   photographic) activity. This tendency complicates (but does not
   completely erase) Stillman's powerful sympathy and outspoken activities
   on behalf of Greek and Cretan independence and self-determination. The
   moment that produced Stillman's album is not the only one in which he
   photographed the Athenian Acropolis. Comparing his photography of 1870
   with his 1882 rephotography of the site is to find changes and slippages
   that highlight the vicissitudes of Stillman's own complex history. It
   also has significant implications for the imagery he produced earlier,
   connecting Stillman's work to the larger constellation of
   nineteenth-century imagery of the Athenian Acropolis.},

Abstract = {Photographs of mid-Victorian cities evoke an unsettling perspective of
   modernity by calling attention to the spasmodic process of societal and
   environmental change in this period. Focusing on four diverse
   commissions undertaken by the professional photographer Thomas Annan in
   Glasgow in the latter half of the nineteenth century, this article
   explores intriguing exchanges between photography and other media in an
   enlarging Victorian print market. This material suggests that we have
   yet to fully appreciate the ways in which photography participated in
   the often-fraught public debate on urban space and civic identity in
   localised environments. The article also explores how recent
   interventions in digital humanities, particularly in the field of
   mapping technologies, have opened up new possibilities of animating and
   reexamining the remote, conventional and impersonal viewpoints that
   characterise photographic representations of metropolitan areas in this
   period.},

Abstract = {The article focuses on the contribution made by several Italian
   photographers (Luigi Pesce, Antonio Giannuzzi, Luigi Montabone) who were
   working in Iran at the beginnings of photography. Their work is studied
   in relation to the life and interests of Shah Naser-ed-Din and compared
   with the experiences of other early photographers, both Iranian and
   western, who were active during the same period at the Qajar court.
   Their contribution, which has resulted from the extensive studies
   carried out on photography collections about Iran, played a fundamental
   role in the creation and development of the singular events of Iranian
   photography. Facilitated by the dense network of diplomatic relations
   created by the Shah to defend the independence of his country and to
   encourage modernisation, this contribution reveals highly original
   characteristics compared with those in other eastern countries. In
   particular, the experience of Italian photographers at court allowed a
   fruitful comparison between different portrayal systems, whilst also
   stimulating the creation of new figurative interests that are found in
   these early origins of Iranian photography.},

Abstract = {Intended to promote the success of rapid industrialisation, especially
   at the time of the first Five-Year Plan (1928-32), Soviet photography
   was disseminated to other countries through the networks of the
   Communist International. The circulation of Soviet photographs in the
   press helped define a specifically communist visual culture,
   characterised by idiosyncratic visual tropes and graphic treatment of
   images through photomontage and dynamic page layout. This article
   highlights the role of graphic designers and illustrators in the
   development of political photomontage in France, particularly through
   periodicals associated with the Communist Party such as Regards and the
   Almanach ouvrier et paysan. These illustrated publications often
   borrowed their iconography and innovative page layout directly from
   Soviet magazines such as USSR in Construction. By showing how images
   have been appropriated and transformed, I suggest that communist editors
   in the early 1930s encouraged a type of militant participation that
   challenged individual authorship.},

Abstract = {The art historical congress organised for the 1877 Rubens Year in
   Antwerp led to the establishment of a committee to collect Rubens's
   works through engraved and photographic reproductions (1880-1910).
   Arguing that the art historical notion of oeuvre originated from the
   increasing reproducibility of works of art, this article contextualises
   the Committee's collection and the fifty-year history of its public
   display. It does so to reveal the changing perception of graphic and
   photographic reproductions between the end of the nineteenth century and
   the interwar period. Whereas the two technologies were originally used
   interchangeably to obtain a comprehensive picture of Rubens's oeuvre,
   they were eventually understood to fulfil separate functions; the first
   artistic, the second documentary. As a consequence, the Antwerp
   collection of Rubens's oeuvre became dispersed.},

Abstract = {In 1861, in his Montreal studio, the Canadian photographer William
   Notman (18261891) took a carte-de-visite portrait of the fugitive
   African-American John Anderson, who had fled to Canada to escape slavery
   in the US. Subsequently, examples of this portrait had been sold at
   abolitionist events. This essay explores visual strategies underlying
   the production of this image, at a time when Anderson had become the
   focus of a transatlantic extradition case that received extensive
   international media attention. The paper argues that the carte-de-visite
   functioned strategically to situate Anderson among free subjects by
   using a visual language of composure and stability, while relying also
   on a certain societal distance between Anderson and his many advocates.
   It shows too how Anderson, when posing for the carte-de-visite,
   negotiated the tensions between objecthood' and subjecthood' within a
   transatlantic context. Finally, it compares Notman's carte-de-visite
   with other examples of antislavery visual culture, such as the Wedgwood
   slave medallion, a daguerreotype abolitionist button and other
   depictions of Anderson.},

Volume = {36},
Number = {2},
Pages = {211-224},
Abstract = {Antiquity occupies a surprisingly central role in Michael Fried's
   account of contemporary art photography. More specifically, on Fried's
   account, photographs of antiquity by Thomas Struth and Patrick
   Faigenbaum stand at the vanguard of contemporary photographic practice.
   This essay examines the place of these photographs in Fried's work. The
   essay suggests that close attention to them can illuminate not only
   unclear turns in Fried's otherwise stunning argument, but also our
   understanding of the phenomenology of `beholding' in antiquity, a
   problem that recent work in ancient aesthetics has made considerably
   more philosophically fraught.},

Title = {Natural Photographs: Optograms and the Fiction of Captured Vision},
Journal = {HISTORY OF PHOTOGRAPHY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {42},
Number = {1},
Pages = {61-77},
Abstract = {An optogram is an image fixed on the retina by a biological,
   photochemical process. In the late nineteenth century, it was widely
   believed that optograms could be excised from dead bodies to procure
   their final visions. Optograms were most frequently compared to
   photographs, so that the retina of the eye was likened to the sensitive
   plate in a camera. Just as photography became capable of superseding
   human vision in the 1870s, optograms discursively came to light as
   latent photographs, making photography the original for preconscious
   sight. These historical inversions of primacy challenge our conceptions
   of the relation between nature and culture in photography, with the
   cultural invention preceding the natural discovery of optography. This
   article examines how an incidental, speculative, and ultimately
   forgotten discovery in the physical sciences was deployed rhetorically
   to reinforce personal or disciplinary beliefs about what photography was
   and what it could do, in realms ranging from physiological laboratories
   to science fiction, from police departments to courtrooms. Analysis of
   optographic discourse indicates that the true value of photography in
   the late nineteenth century was not primarily in the photograph's
   relation to its indexical referent, but in the possibility that it might
   grant access to seeing as another living being.},

Abstract = {This article revisits an obscure episode in the early history of colour
   photography, the collaboration between poet and inventor Charles Cros
   and painter edouard Manet. I consider the genesis of a colour
   photographic copy of Manet's Jeanne (Le Printemps) painting of 1882, a
   work featured in the recent exhibition Manet and Modern Beauty. I argue
   that more can be said about the intermedial layers of this experiment
   from a social, historical and theoretical perspective. Based on letters
   previously unexamined in the scholarship, I provide additional
   historical context about the experiment and reveal that it was not a
   one-off whim of the inventor, but rather a project that involved Jules
   Carpentier, the engineer who, among other achievements, would go on to
   collaborate with the Lumiere brothers in building their cinematographe
   camera. Finally, I consider more closely the sentiments expressed by
   Cros in a letter to Manet about the experiment, sentiments that, I
   argue, help open onto broader questions about the progress of chemistry
   at that historical moment. I conclude with a theoretical question about
   the incunabula of new technologies and their connections to an
   `environmental unconscious'.},

Abstract = {This essay inquires into attention and detail as aesthetic categories in
   the nineteenth-century reception of photography in Scandinavia. It
   circles around what is generally considered to be Sweden's first book
   with original photographs, Johannes Jaeger's Molin's Fountain in
   Photographs, with text (1866), read through two articles on the
   aesthetic potential of the photographic medium written by two
   contemporary Scandinavian art critics. In seven albumen print
   photographs, the book documents a fountain sculpture by Swedish sculptor
   Johan Peter Molin, exhibited at the first Scandinavian Art and
   Industrial Exhibition in 1866. However, the book also includes poetry;
   each photograph is juxtaposed with a poetic stanza that describes the
   part of the sculpture that the photograph reproduces. This paper studies
   the close relation between image and text in Jaeger's volume. It argues
   that a contemporary view of the photographic image, also articulated by
   the Scandinavian art critics, can be discerned from the layout of the
   book - namely, that photography produces images too distractive and
   oversaturated with insignificant details to be aesthetically valuable.
   The visual and verbal framework for the photographs, then, arguably aims
   to overcompensate the distractive qualities of the image, by regulating
   the reader/viewer's attention towards the sculpture and its significant
   details. In this ambition, Jaeger's photobook anticipates a future
   aesthetic appreciation of the photograph in its own right.},

Abstract = {Henri Matisse's experiments during the first decade of the twentieth
   century with colour and form have often been the focus of critical
   analysis of his work, while the radical changes in his figurative style
   have received less attention. These changes owe much to Matisse's
   engagement with visual discourse he encountered in the pages of Mes
   modeles, L'Etude academique, and L'Humanite feminine, illustrated
   journals the artist consulted as source material for a number of his
   paintings and sculptures. The impact of these journals, which
   specialized in photographic academies went beyond the borrowing of a few
   poses. Instead, Matisse's conceptualization of the female nude as an
   erotic spectacle and his use of the arabesque as a signifier of feminine
   voluptee were in large part shaped by the illustrations and editorials
   he observed in these journals. Matisse's use of the photographic
   academie offers a valuable case-study in the eroticization of the
   aesthetic style in the art of one of the most influential artists of the
   early twentieth-century.},

Abstract = {This article examines the use of photography in promoting welfare
   capitalist initiatives at the National Cash Register Company (N.C.R.) of
   Dayton Ohio in the early twentieth century. The article argues that the
   company's founder, John H. Patterson, became interested in both
   industrial betterment schemes and their photographic documentation as a
   result of industrial sabotage. In response to working-class antipathy to
   the cash register itself, which was viewed as a technology of workplace
   surveillance, Patterson introduced factory improvement schemes that
   benefited workers at the Dayton plant. Photographs and lantern slides
   documenting these improvements became central to Patterson's
   international publicity campaign to render the Dayton plant a global
   showcase for progressive business practices. The circulation of these
   images in a global reform network allowed them to function, the article
   argues, as fetishes of Progressive-era utopianism, obscuring the violent
   details of early twentieth-century factory life. Like the cash register
   itself, which became an international commodity in the 1880s, the
   photographs documenting the triumphs of N.C.R.'s industrial betterment
   programme gain their value in relations of exchange, as they circulate
   in a global network of Progressive-era conferences, exhibitions, and
   educational endeavours designed to ameliorate the human costs of
   industrial capitalism.},

Journal = {HISTORY OF PHOTOGRAPHY},

Volume = {42},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {288-305},
Abstract = {When Lore and History of the South Island Maori was published in 1952 it
   filled a vacuum in terms of accessible Ngai Tahu history in the public
   domain. Despite its scholarly shortcomings, it remained one of the only
   readily available texts on Ngai Tahu history for another thirty years. A
   major element of the publication was its inclusion of photographs, all
   taken by the author, William Anderson Taylor. Using the Ngai Tahu
   portraits in Lore and History as a starting point, and informed where
   possible by oral interviews with their descendants, this article
   introduces some of the tribal members who were Taylor's informants,
   friends, and photographic subjects. Through a reading of the
   photographs, the article will briefly trace the trajectory of Taylor's
   relationship with Ngai Tahu and consider how the visual stories
   illuminate the text of Lore and History and Taylor's wider body of work
   with the iwi (tribe) in the first half of the twentieth century. While
   Taylor is best known as an amateur historian and ethnographer, his
   photographic practice was also fundamental to his ethnographic research.
   The photographic contracts that Taylor entered into with the Ngai Tahu
   subjects of his photographs created an environment that facilitated
   exchange, rapport, empathy, and, frequently, enduring bonds.},

Volume = {44},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {Identity photographs used for official employee passbooks at the 1893
   World's Columbian Exposition provide a way to restore visibility to some
   of the massive workforce of employees and officials who are otherwise
   missing in conventional representations of this event. As a tool for
   documentation, a method for the mass production of images and a vehicle
   for constructing individual identity, identity photography had multiple
   functions at the Exposition. The professional photographic studio of
   James and May Gibson, working on site, demonstrates the kind of business
   acumen that was a requirement for the successful mass production of
   identity photographs. Workers were the key to successful Exposition
   businesses, and the food workers and employees of the Wellington
   Catering Company, the leading food concession, were crucial to the
   company's huge financial success. Removed from their original passbooks,
   273 photographs of the company's employees illustrate that for many
   workers this form of photography was more than just an image of
   identification, but also an opportunity for a statement of personal
   identity.},

Journal = {HISTORY OF PHOTOGRAPHY},

Volume = {38},

Pages = {161-172},
Abstract = {This article analyses a suite of black-and-white photographs entitled
   Egyptian Suite produced by the Franco-Lebanese photographer Fouad
   Elkoury between 1985 and 1990 and published in book format in 1999. This
   work retraces the journey to Egypt undertaken by Gustave Flaubert and
   Maxime Du Camp in 1849-50 and calls into question the colonialist
   assumptions that underpin their textual and photographic records.
   Through a close reading of individual images, it is argued that Egyptian
   Suite stages an interplay between authorial control and the randomness
   of mechanical recording in a way that undermines the colonialist
   viewpoint of Flaubert and Du Camp's image of the `Orient'. In his visual
   interrogation of the idea of Egypt advanced in this nineteenth-century
   account, Elkoury also poses questions about the ontology of photography
   and reflects on ways in which photography may be conceptualised as an
   art form.},

Abstract = {Dayanita Singh (b. 1961) has long pursued a practise of close
   relationships with her subjects, human and otherwise. In pairing this
   commitment with disseminating her photographs through book and portable
   museum formats, in which photographs are reused over the course of
   decades, she has developed a practice that she recognises as
   fundamentally archival. This article examines two distinct elements of
   Singh's oeuvre: Myself Mona Ahmed (2001), a book created with her friend
   Mona, a self-described `eunuch' cast out of her community in Delhi; and
   File Room, a constantly unfolding project appearing in multiple book and
   museum formats, focused on the materiality and temporality of the
   archive. I read both as part of Singh's `intimate archive', and
   understand this thread in her work as a feminist practise, one that
   extends to her invitation to viewers to engage with the book and museum
   objects, reworking these images into new intimate archives.},

Abstract = {Olivier Lugon's Le Style documentaire. D'August Sander a Walker Evans,
   19201945, published in 2001, is a thought-provoking book on the
   `documentary style', a term once used by Walker Evans to distinguish his
   own artistic purpose from the propagandistic aims then associated with
   documentary photography. Lugon argues that Evans's works of the 1930s
   should be considered as testimonies of a style in its own right, and
   includes in his discussion the work of photographers such as August
   Sander, Albert Renger-Patzsch and Berenice Abbott. The present study
   discusses Lugon's meticulous argument. Objections can be made against
   the author's point that distinctions between the `New Objectivity' and
   the following `documentary style' are evident, and that Evans's own
   style agenda-often used as a means of characterising his oeuvre but
   fully developed as a category only by Lugon-does properly mirror his and
   his colleagues' practice during the thirties. It is argued here that the
   more one follows the path of style criticism, the more ambiguous
   historical concepts and facts become, and that acceptance of Evans's
   self-apology deflects attention from a long-established tradition of
   charging documentary pictures with aesthetic claims.},

Abstract = {This article considers the fluctuation, in early commentary and
   historiography of photography (1843-1857), between the recurring
   expression of nationalities as criteria of photographic practice and an
   aspiration to regard the new medium as a promising universal language.
   Several key texts from the period are examined, including David
   Brewster's and Elizabeth Eastlake's landmark essays, as well as reports
   from the juries of the Expositions of 1851 and 1855. Discussions of
   photographic nationalities appear to have been prominent in the period,
   and those authors who staked universalist claims for photography may
   have been doing so in reaction to excesses of patriotism. This mostly
   Western European discussion needs, ultimately, to be read in the context
   of the larger globalising function of photography in the nineteenth
   century.},

Abstract = {This paper seeks to shed new light on the much-discussed survey work of
   American photographic pioneer Timothy H. O'Sullivan through a close
   analysis of a hitherto unnoticed collection of King Survey photographs
   at the Univrsity of California's Bancroft Library. Among the notable
   features of this collection is the appearance, in seven rare views of
   Eastern California, of a `T.H.O'S.' monogram, as well as the existence
   of a double set of captions, the one more serious or official, the other
   more informal and sometimes quite humorous. These features, along with
   the eastward orientation of the collection and the particular selections
   of images inserted in the collection's opening and closing sequences,
   suggest a narrational reading of the set that tends to displace, or at
   least to redefine, traditional arguments about O'Sullivan's oeuvre in
   relation to the institutional demands of his employers. The double
   hypothesis of a humorous and narrational reading embodied in the
   collection in turn suggests new ways of interpreting the many narrative
   or reflexive bits contained in O'Sullivan's Western photographs.},

Abstract = {This article investigates the relationship between ancient objects and
   their visual depiction in British archaeological expeditions in the
   Middle East in the mid-nineteenth century. The article focuses on the
   exploration of Ancient Mesopotamia initiated by the British adventurer
   Austen Henry Layard. Modern scholarship on Layard's excavations and
   their reception in Europe has mostly presented them as well-organised,
   purposive, and logical enterprises in which finding objects and
   depicting them had a clear, well-defined purpose. Little attention has
   been paid to the fact that the excavated items were initially objects
   without a clear status, even after they had arrived in Europe. This
   article examines how the application of visual media - whether used for
   scholarship or for publicity - in the field and the museum reflected
   this uncertainty. In this context, photography as a new medium entered
   the chaos of the field and the museum as one among several media that
   brought along its own insecurities rather than a tool ready and able to
   solve a problem.},

Abstract = {Julia Margaret Cameron developed her approach to focus in her portraits
   of the 1860s, when photographic rules and terminology had just begun to
   be established. Cameron's notion of focus has been discussed largely
   from the perspective of whether her photographic style was deliberate.
   This article approaches her work by denying this dichotomy. It argues
   that Cameron's treatment of focus implies a critique of the photographic
   image, for it undermines one of the major photographic goals at this
   time: the rendering of a precise, sharp, accurate record. The truth of
   Cameron's images lies not in their precision but in the allusion they
   make to the sitters' characters by blurring their physical form.
   Impreciseness - the quality of being inexact, ambiguous, nebulous, even
   out-of-focus - encourages viewers to interact with the images while also
   revealing the photographic process.},

Title = {The Photography of Roman Freulich from Poland to Hollywood},
Journal = {HISTORY OF PHOTOGRAPHY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {35},
Number = {4},
Pages = {416-438},
Abstract = {Professional contributions and technical innovations of photographer
   Roman Freulich to the Hollywood film industry are contextualised
   regarding the heritage of his life experiences in Czenstochowa, Poland,
   New York and Los Angeles. The remarkable output of Freulich's
   independent work, consisting of film projects that ventured far beyond
   the relative professional shelter provided by his popular glamour shots,
   emerges in the present study. Freulich sought to give voice to the
   voiceless as evidenced in his self-produced film Broken Earth (1936) -
   the first film to feature a black actor in a starring role - as well as
   his collaborations with the actor Paul Robeson. Freulich's immigration
   to America and the loss of his family members who remained in Poland are
   two legacies that distinguished Freulich from his fellow cameramen.
   Freulich both achieved a fruitful Hollywood career as a photographer of
   contract players - aided by his early use of the 35 mm camera - and
   authored a narrative of Joseph Trumpeldor, founder of the Jewish Legion.
   A survivor of the Holocaust, Freulich did more than preserve these dual
   identities; his lasting achievement lies in the incorporation of a
   veteran's sensitivity toward war in cinematic works that expanded early
   principles of still and moving image photography. Perspective by
   Freulich's family members is presented in original form, illuminating
   chronological events in the life of a pioneering photographer, writer
   and soldier.},

Volume = {34},

Pages = {147-157},
Abstract = {In the 1940s colonial administrators in the Gambia Colony hired local
   photographers to provide a vernacular window into colonial policies,
   procedures and successes. The political and aesthetic implications of
   their still photography were structured by forays into forms of visual
   expression that customarily lay beyond the bounds of the portrait studio
   - especially cine-film and film-strips. This photography inaugurated a
   political consciousness of colonial devolution within the administrative
   hierarchy. Even though Public Relations Office photography was clearly
   based within the bounds of government in the Gambia, it was a
   heterogeneous practice. Far from being a teleological tool of the state,
   colonial administrative photography in the Gambia was actually less
   stable, more innovative and significantly possessed of political and
   aesthetic power as to lead to its own demise.},

Title = {Polaroid, <i>Aperture</i> and Ansel Adams: Rethinking the
   Industry-Aesthetics Divide},
Journal = {HISTORY OF PHOTOGRAPHY},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {33},
Number = {4},
Pages = {354-369},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {This article takes the history of Polaroid photography as an opportunity
   to question a presupposition that underpins much thinking on
   photography: the split between industrial (i.e. useful) applications of
   photography and its fine art (i.e. aesthetic) manifestations. Critics as
   ideologically opposed as Peter Bunnell and Abigail Solomon-Godeau
   steadfastly maintain the existence of this separation Of utility and
   aesthetics in photography, even if they take contrasting views on its
   meaning and desirability. However, Polaroid, at one time the second
   largest company in the photo industry, not only enjoyed close relations
   with those key representatives of fine art photography, Ansel Adams and
   the magazine Aperture, but it also intermittently asserted the
   `essentially aesthetic' nature of its commercial and industrial
   activities in its own internal publications. The divide between industry
   and aesthetics is untenable, then, but this does not mean that the two
   poles were reconciled at Polaroid. While Aperture may have underplayed
   its commercial connections and Polaroid may have retrospectively
   exaggerated its own contributions to the development of fine art
   photography, most interesting are the contradictions and tensions that
   arise when the industrial and the aesthetic come together. The present
   article draws on original research undertaken at the Polaroid
   Corporation archives held at the Baker Library, Harvard, as well as with
   the Ansel Adams correspondence with Polaroid, held at the Polaroid
   Collections in Concord, Massachusetts.},

Abstract = {This article is concerned with photographic images and identity
   photographs utilised for military counterinsurgent policing in Guatemala
   City during the civil war (1960-96), in the context of Latin America's
   Cold War. The article explores the historical conditions that made
   militarised policing and its photographic record possible in Guatemala,
   focusing on a dossier produced in the early 1980s known as Diario
   Militar. The article pays attention to aesthetic and evidentiary regimes
   that rely on the indexical force of photographs under circumstances in
   which indexicality fails. In doing so, it elaborates on
   counterrevolutionary policing as a way of seeing and not being seen,
   producing photographic images that at once identify political subjects
   and attempt to disappear their identities, and how these photographic
   imaginaries are being re-signified in contemporary struggles for justice
   in postwar Guatemala.},

Journal = {HISTORY OF PHOTOGRAPHY},

Volume = {41},

Pages = {188-203},
Abstract = {This article examines the production and consumption of illustrated song
   lantern slides. Motivated by the commercial success of Tin Pan Alley
   songs, slide companies began illustrating songs with live action
   photography in the early years of the twentieth century. Shown between
   reels of film, the slides were an attraction themselves and an integral
   part of the filmgoers' experience. The photographic experimentation in
   these slides, especially that of the firm Scott and Van Altena, is
   surprisingly novel. They frequently use multiple photograph negatives to
   exaggerate spatial and scale differences or frame narrative scenes. The
   author concludes that the layering and scale differences frequently seen
   in these slides allowed the company to expedite manufacture by recycling
   photographic images and also appealed to a popular taste for visual
   tricks in modern American visual culture. Although the imagery was
   nostalgic and conventional, the compositions challenged the viewer to
   see in a new, fragmented way. The often surreal effects show that the
   line between avant-garde experimental photography and commercial
   photography was not so clearly drawn.},

Abstract = {This study examines the meanings of late-nineteenth-century interior
   photography, a widespread but critically ignored practice. Drawing on
   collections in the USA, it considers three types of domestic interior
   photographs: house books or bound series of photographs taken by
   professional photographers to document the homes of middle- or
   upper-class families; photographs taken by the inhabitants of homes to
   document their own interiors; and photographs of college dormitory
   rooms. Consideration of the role narrative, aesthetics and biography
   play in the creation and preservation of interior photographs
   complicates the presumption that interior photography may offer a
   transparent view of the private spaces of nineteenth-century Americans.
   Rather, in the context of nineteenth-century cultures that appreciated
   both the analytical and metonymic values of photographs, views of
   interiors may be understood as specific kinds of visual rhetoric
   employed to make sense of domestic spaces over time.},

Abstract = {Framing photography and policing through Michael Foucault's concept of
   counter-conducts in his writings on governmentality, this article
   discusses photography's provocations within colonial governmentality of
   the Irish insurgent movements of the mid nineteenth century. In 1866,
   British authorities legislated for suspension of habeas corpus in
   response to what they identified as the Fenian threat to the ideals of
   the modern liberal state. Fenian insurgency was not just an
   anti-colonial movement but an asymmetrical political fraternity with a
   trans-Atlantic membership that included retired American Civil War
   veterans. Mobilised for the identification and surveillance of Fenians
   traversing across the Atlantic and the Irish Sea, photography was used
   to arrest the likenesses of individuals whose mobility threatened the
   security of the state and its colonies. In this process, the
   photograph's mass reproducibility and mobility as a material
   image-object was pressed into action to identify suspected insurgents.
   Exploring the entwined histories of photography, policing and the Fenian
   Irish, the article discusses how photography simultaneously contributed
   to and undermined colonial governmentality.},

Abstract = {This article analyses a representative selection of photographs from the
   Archivo General de la Nacion Argentina produced by an army of
   photographers who assiduously chronicled Eva and Juan Domingo Peron's
   public engagements. These images were shrewdly informed by an array of
   popular forms (tango lyrics, the storylines of photo-romances, movies,
   and radio serials), and by a set of visual models borrowed from the
   nineteenth-century photography tradition, commercial photography studios
   of celebrities, Hollywood fashion codes, Soviet-related paradigms
   anchored in the legacy of the socialist and anarchist movements of early
   twentieth-century Argentina, and from royal and religious iconography.
   Through their careful staging before the camera, Peron and Eva
   amalgamated these visual traditions with their political content in
   order to reach and unify the multiple socio-political constituencies of
   Argentina at the time. The conventional aesthetic - in terms of view
   angles, lighting, and composition - of such images granted their
   movement a patina of legitimacy and the sense of an enduring legacy.},

Abstract = {In the 1920s art museums in the United States began to collect and
   display photographs by Alfred Stieglitz and other leading photographers
   as works of art. Previous scholars have acknowledged this movement's
   significance in Stieglitz's struggle for the institutional recognition
   of photography. They have, however, scarcely queried the conditions
   under which this movement began. This article scrutinises the
   circumstances under which the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, MA, accepted
   prints from Stieglitz and other practitioners of the medium. It posits
   that the Boston Museum's decision to accept these prints was motivated
   by its protean curator Ananda Kentish Coomaraswamy's interest in
   pictorialist and photo-secessionist photography's creative and political
   possibilities as well as in Stieglitz's life and work. Stieglitz's
   pictures appealed to Coomaraswamy because he recognised in them ways in
   which the American photographer was referencing strands of classical
   South Asian aesthetics to develop more inclusive and more symbolic works
   of American art. One of these filaments was Stieglitz's absorption of a
   codified language of hand gestures assumed by dancers and deities that
   Coomaraswamy was concurrently documenting and interpreting in his
   writings, photographs and films to elevate maligned traditions of South
   Asian sculpture and performance as Art. In recovering this narrative of
   Coomraswamy and Stieglitz's overlapping lives and works, this article
   begins to disentangle histories of collecting, of modernist photography
   and of the crystallisation of South Asian art history as a scholarly
   discipline.},

Abstract = {This article explores the intellectual underpinnings of the late-1960s
   Japanese photography collective Provoke. It argues that Provoke was more
   radical and theoretically inflected than is conventionally understood,
   its project being the forging of a scientific' photography capable of
   unveiling the untruth' of established relations of power and knowledge
   production in Japan. I present Provoke's central figure to be Taki Kji,
   who in 1967-68 published a series of articles that introduced
   structuralism into Japanese image discourse and established the basis
   for Provoke's theoretically informed practice, or praxis. The article
   outlines how, in response to a variety of influences (Roland Barthes,
   Matsumoto Toshio, and Kevin Lynch, among others, but apparently not
   Antonio Gramsci or Louis Althusser), Taki formulated the notion of a
   unified and self-regulating ideological environment' (kanky) that is
   made manifest in a variety of seemingly neutral and benign cultural
   forms. Additionally, he theorised a semiotically transgressive
   photographic image, derived from Barthes's early studies of photography,
   which he believed could escape language and code - and thereby the
   ideological superstructure. I conclude by showing that Taki's
   emancipatory project, while singular in relation to contemporaneous
   Marxist oppositional endeavours in Europe, was ultimately
   self-defeating: the efforts of Provoke's photographers to strip their
   images of readable codes by deliberately mishandling' their cameras only
   worked to create new ones, and the shakiness and blurriness of the
   resulting photographs became a mere style.},

Abstract = {The recent publication of a large selection of Diane Arbus's private
   papers, contact sheets and prints presents an opportunity to re-examine
   existing interpretations of her photography. More than merely overcoming
   the Sontag-based critical tradition of evaluating Arbus on moral and
   psychological terms, this article is concerned with widening the scope
   of inquiry. Areas explored include Arbus's conceptual approach to the
   magazine photo-essay, her ongoing failure after 1961 to publish her
   essays as she had conceived them, her formal and technical
   experimentation in pursuit of originality and snapshot-like
   authenticity, and the connections between her pursuit of `insideness'
   and the New Journalism movement of the 1960s.},

Abstract = {The images from Moriyama's earliest photobooks - Nihon gekij shashinch
   (Nippon Theatre), Shashin yo saynara (Farewell Photography), and Kariudo
   (A Hunter) - are among his most highly respected works, yet comparably
   little is known about the processes and contexts of their production.
   This essay examines the photographer's early collaborative projects with
   the writer and dramatist Terayama Shuji, as well as such important
   magazine serial projects as `Akushidento (Accident)' and `Nanika eno
   tabi (Searching Journeys)', with a view to better understanding his
   formative years. The analysis draws heavily from the notes that Moriyama
   often wrote to accompany his photo-stories and argues that his most
   important thematic terrain is the often unsettling tension between two
   modalities of the photograph: on the one hand as `cold', `authentic'
   documentary record, and on the other as emotionally affecting simulation
   of meaningful contact with the external world.},

Abstract = {This article explores turn-of-the-twentieth-century occult photographic
   experiments by Louis Darget and Hippolyte Baraduc that eliminated the
   technological medium of the photographic equipment and worked with an
   altogether different kind of medium: namely, the so-called vital fluid'.
   These experiments fit into their era's aim for scientific objectivity;
   however, by striving to exclude the camera from the image-making
   process, they highlight the complex media-theoretical dynamics at work
   in Lorraine Daston and Peter Galison's mechanical objectivity'. It is
   these media-theoretical implications that form the subject matter of
   this article. I explore the tension between Darget's and Baraduc's
   photographic practice, which stresses immediacy even as it continually
   enacts medial tautologies'. Their attempts to capture the subtle media
   of effluvia reveal the presence of other media within the images: that
   of the technical apparatus (the emulsifying liquid) and that of the
   surrounding environment (the fluid of air). Thereby, their practice
   continually blurs the line between its object of representation and its
   medium of representation. This peculiar medial situation makes their
   experiments into sites for the analysis of the entwinement between
   objects of knowledge and their means of knowing as well as for the study
   of the attempt to grasp with the exact methods of science that which is
   beyond the purported limits of science.},

Abstract = {Like many authors of the long nineteenth-century period, Henry James was
   both fascinated and troubled by photography's capacity to extend social
   relations across distance and time. As this article will show, in The
   Awkward Age (1899) and `Crapy Cornelia' (1909) he represents photography
   as enabling new forms of virtual flirtation. The Awkward Age projects
   its protagonist, an adolescent girl named Nanda, into a network of
   photographic exchange. This leads to serious problems when her mother
   seeks to win Nanda a suitor. The text not only depicts photographs as
   modes of flirtation; it also shares with photography a concern for
   deixical signification. The book presents the identity of its individual
   characters through a blank writing style that is both flirtatious and
   photographic in its pleasurable deferral of meaning. By the time he
   wrote `Crapy Cornelia', James had adjusted to the new instantaneous and
   portable photography. As a result, this later story portrays obsolete
   carte-de-visite photography in nostalgic terms: as a form that enabled
   affective (and effective) networks of connection, even between the
   living and the dead.},

Abstract = {In this article I explore photogravure catalogues of the Berlin
   Photographic Company (BPC), a print publisher founded in 1862
   specialising in reproductions of works of art, and in particular those
   published by its New York office from 1892 to 1916. In promoting its
   reproductions, the BPC connected social, aesthetic and technical
   knowledge, emphasising the quality of photogravure technologies while
   listing hundreds of images from diverse styles, historical periods,
   genres and subjects to appeal to a wide audience. The Company was
   sensitive to its customers' cultural aspirations and recognised that the
   US market was different from that in Europe because of its less rigid
   class structure and a public motivated by ambitions for cultural
   knowledge and social mobility. With its wide range of reproductions from
   Old Masters, nineteenth-century popular and Academic artists, and later
   early twentieth-century modernists, the BPC appealed to these ambitions
   by providing photogravure prints - the company specialty - in different
   sizes, mounts and costs to a public of diverse tastes and economic
   means. The BPC's innovations included its global locations in Berlin,
   Paris, London and New York and its creation of neologisms combining
   format and process tying the materiality of photogravures to a range of
   sizes and prices.},

Abstract = {Histories of the carte de visite and the photographic album rarely
   consider adequately the intersections between modes of viewership
   associated with collecting and archiving, and assertions of national
   identity in the nineteenth century. Alessandro Pavia's Album dei Mille,
   completed in 1867 to commemorate the Expedition of the Thousand, a
   defining episode in the Italian Risorgimento, presents the portrait card
   of 824 of the 1,092 men known to have participated. The photographs are
   ordered alphabetically and erratically sourced - although Pavia took
   many in his own studio - and bound into a massive album. The Album
   mobilises practices of viewing and organisation that come from both the
   archive and the collection, constituting a case in which contradictory
   modes of constructing narrative, engaging historical time, and
   understanding the materiality of photography produce a complex mode of
   viewership significant to the histories of photography and identity
   construction in the newly formed Italian nation. Seen from the purviews
   of the collection and the archive, this episode in the history of
   photography has implications for understanding how the album and the
   portrait card shaped the way photographs were viewed and used in the
   second half of the nineteenth century, and more specifically in
   nation-building movements such as the Italian Risorgimento.},

   identify potential acquisitions, and can perhaps be seen to be a
   consequence of the Napoleonic conflicts a few decades earlier which had

Abstract = {Between 1952 and 1974, Henri Cartier-Bresson significantly revised his
   understanding of himself as a photojournalist. This article analyses
   that change through close readings of his book, The Decisive Moment
   (1952), an interview in Le Monde (1974), and other published statements
   and unpublished letters by Cartier-Bresson. It draws on interviews and
   correspondence with his widow Martine Franck, with his friend and
   representative Helen Wright, and with associates at Magnum Photos. It
   argues that what appears from a superficial reading of the interview to
   be a rejection of photography and photojournalism was in fact
   Cartier-Bresson's first public expression of a long-simmering opposition
   to the consumer society - which he as an ecologist strongly opposed -
   and to fashion and advertising photography, which he believed promoted
   unnecessary consumption. It concludes that Cartier-Bresson reinterpreted
   his past by seeing himself as a surrealist to the denial of having done
   photojournalism. The article is predicated on the belief that
   understanding the change in Cartier-Bresson's own conception of his work
   is essential to a full understanding of it.},

   thoroughness, recording the student militants and the forces of order
   during their nightly skirmishes. He documented numerous demonstrations,
   rallies, political meetings and other major events and portrayed the
   major student leaders and politicians. Caron produced several images
   that went beyond daily news photographs to become lasting symbols of the
   rebellion.},

Journal = {HISTORY OF PHOTOGRAPHY},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {31},
Number = {4},
Pages = {348-364},

Abstract = {In 1893 the colonial administrator and anthropologist, Everard Ferdinand
   im Thurn, gave an illustrated lecture, entitled Anthropological Uses of
   the Camera, in which he used more than thirty lantern slides. Im Thurn
   argued that, in addition to photographing the measured physical body,
   `primitive folk' as `living beings' in their `natural conditions' could
   also be captured on film for the advancement of anthropological science.
   Although this lecture has been seen as representing a humanistic turn in
   anthropological photography, little attention has been given to the ways
   in which lantern slide technology participated in and facilitated this
   shift. The present paper demonstrates that im Thurn used the lantern
   slide to re-assert and re-define the scope of anthropological inquiry,
   altering the connections between morality and race and culture and
   nature. Lantern slides not only permitted heightened public visibility
   of particular selections of the body but also normalized classifications
   of race, nature, and culture. By situating lantern slides as
   photographic translations that travel through various spaces, we can
   begin to understand how the lantern slide was enlisted by im Thurn to
   uphold anthropology as a science, to alter what constituted a proper
   anthropological subject for the photograph, and ultimately to legitimize
   himself as a scholar.},

Abstract = {In the early 1920s, Alvin Langdon Coburn made a series of photographs in
   the city of Manchester, England. This little known work was commissioned
   by local industrialists, elected officials and a gentleman's club.
   Coburn's photographs illustrated the sponsor's promotional books and
   brochures. These photographs of the city open up a number of issues
   which are addressed in this essay: the attraction of pictorialist
   photography to Manchester's industrialists and leaders, the integrity of
   an artist's commercial work, notions of worker-employee relations, and
   the connection between the use of photography and the changing economic
   fortunes of Manchester.},

Title = {`The Pictures Which We Publish To-Day Are Fearful to Look Upon': The
   Circulation of Images of Atrocity During the American Civil War},
Journal = {HISTORY OF PHOTOGRAPHY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {45},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {20-33},
Month = {JAN 2},
Abstract = {This article explores the circulation of photographs of prisoners of war
   that were taken at the US General Hospital in Annapolis, Maryland in
   1864. More specifically, it considers the publication of these images as
   wood engravings in Harper's Weekly's illustrated newspaper as part of a
   broader network of photographic circulation, and the circulation of
   images of atrocity during the American Civil War. This project follows
   recent interventions in photographic history that have emphasised
   reproduction and circulation, and that have decentred the photographic
   print as the primary site for the production of meaning. By examining
   the multiple visual and narrative contexts in which photographs of the
   Annapolis prisoners appeared, including as wood engravings in Harper's
   Weekly, this article reveals how divergent meanings were ascribed to the
   images, as both the press and the public sought to make sense of the
   prisoners' deterioration and to use their images for political purposes.
   Ultimately, the article employs circulation as a methodology to
   understand how audiences used photographs to make sense of the seemingly
   ineffable trauma and devastation of the American Civil War. This project
   also demonstrates how Harper's Weekly relied upon an existing public
   archive - of text and images, particularly cartes de visite - to report
   the news and to further its rhetorical position. It is important to
   highlight that the images in this article are disturbing. They show men
   in states of significant emaciation and were presumably taken without
   full consent. These pictures are shown as part of an effort to
   understand the ways in which images of atrocity were circulated in the
   nineteenth century, and, as such, requires that we consider the
   appropriateness of publishing and exhibiting such images both then and
   now. A question of care and of an ethics of looking must be at the
   forefront of this critical engagement.},

Abstract = {This article contextualises documentary photographs taken of
   working-class holidaymakers in Blackpool by Humphrey Spender in the late
   1930s. Working for Tom Harrisson's northern branch of Mass Observation,
   Spender recorded how the residents of `Worktown' (Bolton, Lancashire)
   spent the `fifty-second week' or summer holiday period of each year.
   Harrisson recruited Spender for this task because his camera was an
   ideal apparatus for recording the most mundane details of average
   British lives. Yet these images (indeed, all the photographs taken by
   Spender for Mass Observation) were used only sparingly by the
   organisation at the time of their creation. This article examines
   reasons for this, suggesting that Harrisson's understanding of
   photographic realism in combination with his perception of national
   identity served to highlight photography's ability to undermine rather
   than affirm the goals of Mass Observation as Harrisson had conceived
   them.},

Abstract = {The photomontages by Kazimierz Podsadecki and Janusz Maria Brzeski are
   among the most important of their kind in inter-war Poland. These works
   have a rightful place among avant-garde experiments in typography,
   photography and film; on the other hand, as illustrations made for a
   sensationalist press, they belong solidly to the mass cultural
   entertainment of their day. This essay offers an interpretation of
   Podsadecki's and Brzeski's visual idiom in relation both to an
   avant-garde programme and to the discursive practice of popular
   illustrated magazines, in which modernity was mythologized through
   trivial stereotypes. Avant-garde and popular codes meet in the realm of
   cinema, and in the subject of incipient Americanisation (i.e.
   technologisation) of daily life. Brzeski and Podsadecki's works betray a
   constructivist utopia accented by melodramatic catastrophe, for instance
   Chicago as a ``city of crime{''} or the future as a world ruled by
   machines.},

Abstract = {Having pioneered the use of photography as a diagnostic and therapeutic
   tool in portraits of his female patients at the Surrey County Lunatic
   Asylum in the 1850s, Hugh Welch Diamond is typically remembered as the
   `father of psychiatric photography'. This parochial label and the pathos
   of these well-known images have occluded our contemporary view of
   Diamond, who was regarded by his peers as one of the leaders of British
   photography. A recently identified album in the George Eastman House
   collection raises questions about our assumptions that Diamond
   approached photography purely in an instrumental or utilitarian way. In
   fact, the album suggests that at the same time as Diamond was immersed
   in the documentation of his patients, he was experimenting with
   dramatically expressive portraits in ways that forecast the work of
   pictorialists such as Henry Peach Robinson and Julia Margaret Cameron.
   The album's superabundance of portraits of women makes a compelling case
   for Diamond's preoccupation with the woman as muse, whether for the
   purposes of art or science.},

Abstract = {This article explores innovations in photographic production and
   experimentation in Australia, especially Sydney, from 1935 to 1940.
   While many photographers and photographic societies were still promoting
   the aesthetics of Pictorialism, others were responding to new demands
   and opportunities provided by publishing, advertising, international
   expositions, local exhibitions and architecture. After introducing some
   of the forces for change, where there was often an easy exchange between
   photography and design, the article examines four case studies from 1937
   to 1940. Three of these were generated by international expositions; all
   involved different types of photomurals and collaborations across the
   arts. These collaborations were instrumental in helping to shape
   Australian modernism and a postwar recovery within the arts.},

Abstract = {This article traces the circulation of photographs taken in Beijing in
   1865 and 1866 by Georges Morache, a medical doctor stationed at the
   French legation. Including sights of the city, portraits and staged
   outdoor scenes depicting local trades, these pictures were disseminated
   from the mid-1870s in two directions simultaneously. While they were
   issued for about twenty-five years as wood-engraved reproductions in
   illustrated travel publications, they also circulated up until 2003 as
   prints and lantern slides within anthropological institutions. This
   article examines the diverse material and semiotic adaptations that
   these photographs were subjected to along their twofold circulation. Not
   only verifying the mutability of photographic meaning, this case also
   highlights affinities between the concerns of institutionalised
   anthropology, popular education and illustrated travel publications in
   the late nineteenth century. Ultimately, the dynamic circulation of
   these photographs in the West fulfilled a popular desire to scrutinise
   Chinese people and culture - a desire that was contingent on the
   informal empire upheld by western powers in China since the Opium Wars.},

Journal = {HISTORY OF PHOTOGRAPHY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {39},
Number = {2},
Pages = {177-193},
Month = {APR 3},
Abstract = {Contemporary photographers Rineke Dijkstra and Nan Goldin each seek
   intimacy through portrait making. Perhaps not surprisingly, their work
   is most frequently framed in terms of either empathy or voyeurism.
   Considering selections from Goldin's The Ballad of Sexual Dependency and
   Dijkstra's New Mothers photographs, this essay argues that instead of
   approaching the text critically through the lens of `voyeurism', this
   work is best explored by focusing on the question of `intimacy'. This
   essay situates the notion of intimacy both theoretically and
   historically, considering the workings of intimacy and its relationship
   to the persistence of inside/outside binaries (most frequently applied
   in discussion of the dynamics of the photographer/subject relationship).
   Looking at the way intimacy is represented through the surfaces of skin
   and the pregnant or maternal body, this essay speaks to questions of
   intention and critical reception and considers the ways in which
   photographers, subjects, and audiences engage with photographs as
   material objects.},

Abstract = {This article investigates the first decade and a half of photographic
   practice in the Australian colonies from the perspective of family
   participation in the portrait marketplace. The article argues that this
   period has largely been narrated around determining the point of
   photography's arrival. This approach risks underplaying both the
   significant innovation and entrepreneurship that defined early
   photographic practice in this part of the British Empire and how
   photographic culture engaged with settlers' dispossession of First
   Nations land. This is not to say that early colonial Australian
   photography developed in isolation. Rather, the evasion of early British
   photography patents, as well as Australia's geographic location diluted
   the perpetuation of the English studio model in this part of the world.
   This, in turn, impacted the kinds of individuals who practised as
   daguerreian photographers in the colonies and - because of the appetites
   of colonial society, particularly settler families - the types of
   photographic products offered.},

Abstract = {This article examines the photographic practices of the French Communist
   Party during the Third Period', when the Communist International adopted
   its most intransigent policies. Through an analysis of the magazines Nos
   Regards and Regards sur le monde du travail, I show that the Communists
   adopted a montage technique which expanded the practice from
   juxtapositions on the page to juxtapositions orchestrated across the
   whole publication. Photographs were thus used to articulate the conflict
   between opposed economic and political systems through sustained
   comparisons of capitalist countries and the fatherland of the
   International proletariat'. In the process, the magazines became
   collective works rather than miscellanies of individual articles,
   mounting a direct challenge to the practices of the bourgeois press.
   This challenge was also extended to the role of the press photographer,
   which the Communists proposed to supplant through the collaboration of
   worker photographers. Thus, the very work of photography was to be
   reimagined.},

Abstract = {This article examines Catharine Weed Barnes Ward's campaign for women's
   access to photography at the end of the nineteenth century. At a time
   when Victorian women's roles held firmly to the domestic, Barnes/Ward
   set a model for women through her photographic imagery, writings and
   public speaking in America and Great Britain. The findings illustrate
   how one woman of upper class means guided women of her social equal to
   pursue photography as an artistic expression, and for those women of
   more modest circumstances, she proposed photography as an avenue of
   financial remuneration.},

Abstract = {This article examines the association between Wirephotos - the brand
   name that became a generic term for news photographs sent by telegraph,
   telephone or radio, also sometimes described as radiophotos - and
   objectivity. It suggests that many wirephotos functioned by making
   visible not places or events, but the drama of communication, understood
   as the challenging process of articulating messages across space and
   time. The article also considers Edward Steichen's use of Associated
   Press photographer Max Desfor's wirephotos in the exhibition Korea - The
   Impact of War, at the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 1951. It
   thinks through Steichen's use of the metaphor of `bridging' to describe
   the work of press photography and asks what it can tell us about
   photographic circulation and communication, particularly in
   mid-twentieth-century USA. By playing on the repertoire of meanings
   associated with bridges, Desfor's Flight of Refugees Across Wrecked
   Bridge in Korea can be read as reflecting on its own medium's
   limitations. As it circulated and recirculated in different formats,
   Desfor's bridge photograph dramatised communication's difficulty, and
   the always-present potential of failure in press photography's effort to
   bridge distance.},

Abstract = {This article focuses on the photographs of sculptures, in particular
   Raffaelle Monti's veiled figures, taken by the London Stereoscopic and
   Photographic Company at the 1862 International Exhibition, to explore
   the relationship between vision and touch in the appeal of stereographs.
   Their apparent simplicity as reproductions of works of art belies a rich
   formal and conceptual complexity that attends to many of the issues
   raised by the Exhibition and its critics, at the time and since. The
   appeal of stereographs of sculptures can be conceptualised in the
   consonance between sculpture and photography as media that relied on
   mechanical production and reproduction, making the shift from sculpture
   to stereo one of different iterations rather than translation from one
   medium to another - both relied on the disavowal of the anonymous,
   mechanical labour that went into making them.},

Abstract = {This essay places Elizabeth Thompson's (later Lady Butler, 1846-1933)
   sensational success at the 1874 Royal Academy exhibition, and the
   negotiations over the sale of copyrights of her work, in the context of
   an art world being reconfigured by the commercialisation and the
   commodification of images, including those by and of women. It shows how
   photography - in particular, carte-de-visite portraits of artists played
   an important role in this burgeoning market, and in the new laws
   required to regulate it. It uses the later example of Mary ('Patsy')
   Cornwallis West (nee Fitzpatrick, 1858-1920) to illuminate Thompson's
   unease at being photographed; the confusion concerning copyright laws
   and the sale of photographic portraits to the public; and the ambivalent
   fascination of the time with photographs of women celebrities as
   `professional beauties'.},

Abstract = {As the ultimate expression of modernity in the nineteenth century,
   photography was integral to the introduction of the modern state to
   Iran. The use of photography as a political tool and as a means of
   recording information during the reign of Naser-ed-Din Shah Qajar
   (184896) is well documented. Less well known is the popularity of the
   camera as a shortcut to illusionistic painting and realistic portraiture
   in the European Academic style. This paper examines the historical
   context of the introduction of photography; considers patronage, art
   training and production at the court and the interactions with
   photography; and reviews evidence for the impact of photography on the
   development of Iranian art, as evidenced by the career of Mohammad
   Ghaffari, Kamal-ol-Molk (ca. 18481940), who is generally considered to
   be the father of Iranian modernism.},

Journal = {HISTORY OF PHOTOGRAPHY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {38},

Pages = {40-55},
Abstract = {Australian cameraman Frank Hurley was stationed in the Middle East
   between 1940 and 1946, initially with the Australian Commonwealth
   Government's Department of Information and later with the British
   Ministry of Information. During that period he estimated that he
   travelled over 200,000 miles, often with military escorts, filming and
   photographing not only key military engagements but also peoples and
   scenery in many countries, including Egypt, Israel, Palestine, Iraq and
   Iran. Focusing on Hurley's filming of the British Ministry of
   Information's propaganda film, The Road to Russia, in Iraq and Iran in
   1944, this paper examines the day-to-day relationships between military
   occupation and the practices of photography and film-making, especially
   in so far as they share a common investment in Orientalist dispositions.
   Drawing on the work of geographer Derek Gregory and film theorist Edward
   Dimendberg, it identifies three modes in Hurley's photographs and films:
   the projection and mastery of centrifugal space, the staging of the
   Middle East as Orientalist spectacle, and the crisis of spatial mastery.},

Abstract = {This essay examines the use of photography by the Prussian East Asian
   Expedition during its two visits to Japan in 1860-61. Among the
   expeditions sent to Japan in the two decades following the opening of
   the country to foreign trade in 1854, that dispatched by the Kingdom of
   Prussia and headed by Count Friedrich zu Eulenburg was arguably best
   equipped to create a comprehensive photographic record, having at its
   disposal an impressive range of up-to-date photographic equipment and
   employing at one time no fewer than three photographers who operated in
   association with two official artists working in more traditional media.
   Nevertheless, there were problems. The employment of three photographers
   was a belated response to the discovery that the official photographer,
   Carl Bismarck, was lacking the experience and skill required to fulfill
   his task, and, even though this and other difficulties were overcome,
   the resulting portfolio had a limited circulation. Drawing on
   contemporary Prussian sources, including a recently discovered group of
   these images, this essay attempts to reconstruct the photographic work
   of the Eulenburg mission and explain its disappearance.},

Abstract = {The launch of the Royal Mail's parcel post service in 1883 was
   concurrent with the increase of amateur photographers in Britain,
   supporting new ways for this group of practitioners to come together
   through postal photographic clubs. This article explores the influence
   that members' participation, in assembling and distributing the
   portfolios shared by each club, had on photographers' understanding of
   their own role in the production of photographic meanings and values. It
   does so by discussing the postal service as a technology of
   communication and transport; the virtual space created through
   circulating portfolios as a modern network; and the conjoint acts of
   writing, reading and looking at photographs that constituted each
   portfolio as reframing photographers' idea of self. The article covers
   the period from the early 1880s to the early 1910s, by which time postal
   photographic clubs had become almost ubiquitous in Britain. The article
   demonstrates that this process implicitly challenged the
   institutionalisation of this period's dominant photographic discourse.},

Abstract = {The intertwined development of popular photography and cycling in
   Britain was felt so close that, in the 1880s, contemporary commentators
   could write of cyclo-photographers'. The camera apparatus available at
   this time, bulky and fragile, was largely impractical to carry on a
   ride, and thus cyclo-photographers joined outdoor photographers in
   asking manufacturers for simpler and easier to operate cameras. However,
   a close reading of primary sources reveals that such demands were also
   the result of a new engagement with the possibility of seeing enabled by
   cycling itself. What was the cyclo-photographers' experience of visual
   modernity? This article explores whether, and in what ways, the parallel
   emergence of a desire for compact cameras was linked to the new, and
   interconnected, ways of moving and seeing that the engagement with these
   two modern cultural technologies had made possible.},

Title = {The Ties that Bind Hans Bellmer's <i>Tenir au Frais</i> to Heinrich Von
   Kleist},
Journal = {HISTORY OF PHOTOGRAPHY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {36},
Number = {4},
Pages = {414-421},
Abstract = {This article examines Hans Bellmer's photographic collage of 1958 Tenir
   au frais (Keep Cool), a work produced as part of his exploration of the
   theme of the female body bound with string. The paper argues that an
   interpretation of this image in the context of French Surrealism must
   take into account the fact that it appeared on the cover of le
   surrealisme, meme, a journal that was filled with praise for the German
   Romantic writer Heinrich von Kleist. Tenir au frais has been interpreted
   variously, but little attention has been paid to its material context as
   the cover of the Surrealist journal. The Surrealists were political and
   cultural radicals, and their aim was a profound transformation of the
   world, a world that had generated atrocities beyond imagination in two
   World Wars. Shock was an important element in the work of the
   Surrealists, who often used images of sexual violence to challenge the
   status quo. The roots of this preoccupation lay in the writings of the
   literary heroes of the movement. This article argues that material
   context is crucial when considering possible meanings and that the image
   is tied to the Surrealist preoccupation with the German Romantic writer
   Heinrich von Kleist. Kleist's Penthesilea was particularly cherished by
   the group. They were interested in his portrayal of sexual frenzy, in
   how love and violence are fused in the play and in the psychological
   realism and tension in this ecstatic work. Bellmer's photographic
   collage provides an allusive illustration to the text on Kleist and
   connects with his drama on a number of levels, for it conveys
   extraordinary emotional distress but also the physical turmoil of the
   play in which the theme of binding is evident throughout.},

Abstract = {Alvin Langdon Coburn and Henry James first met in 1905 in the United
   States. Their acquaintance was renewed in England in the following year
   and developed into an important relationship. A well known feature of
   this was their collaboration on the New York edition of James's works;
   Coburn photographed symbolic scenes which were used as frontispieces.
   The year 1906 also marked Coburn's initial visit to Moor Park, a fine
   eighteenth-century house in Hertfordshire. There he took the first of
   what was to become an archive of photographs of the property; the owner,
   Lady Ebury, became his pupil and collaborator in the publication of Moor
   Park Rickmansworth in 1915. Although the book was conceived some years
   after Coburn first met James, and the photographs in it were taken on
   different occasions during the intervening period, it is imbued with the
   spirit of the James-inspired illustration project. In James's The Spoils
   of Poynton the owner is forced to leave to make way for her son and his
   fiancee. Lady Ebury left Moor Park because it was sold; thus the
   photographs in Moor Park Rickmansworth can be read symbolically as a
   memorial to a vanishing way of life.},

Abstract = {This article concerns the work of a group of British wildlife
   photographers just prior to World War I. A photographic exhibition in
   1912 by members of the Zoological Photographic Club led to the
   publication of Wild Life: An Illustrated Monthly, edited by Douglas
   English. Wild Life was published between 1913 and 1918, and, especially
   in the pre-war issues, it achieved an impressive standard of
   reproduction of natural history photography. Mammals and birds were
   pictured in their natural habitats; hitherto most wildlife pictures had
   been taken in Zoos, where the subjects were shown out of context. The
   editor of Wild Life believed that nature-photographers should have an
   opportunity to mitigate or correct artistic defects in their negatives.
   I argue that it is a wildlife photograph's consideration of content and
   context that determines its artistic merit.},

Abstract = {The late nineteenth century saw a mass of photographic projects which
   harnessed the energies of amateur photographers in making `record
   photographs'. This essay explores the tensions between record
   photography and the aesthetic aspirations of amateur photographers who
   participated in the photographic survey movement in England between 1885
   and 1918. The aim was to harness the evidential qualities of photographs
   to recording antiquities, ancient buildings and other social and
   material survivals of the past for the benefit of the future. These
   loosely associated groups of photographers, in local camera clubs and
   the photographic sections of local antiquarian and archaeological
   societies, were united in a sense of purpose, attempts at institutional
   rigour and, above all, a belief in the evidential force of photographs.
   Yet their efforts were threatened at every turn with the dissipation of
   such objectives through the ambiguities of photographic inscription and
   of style, and through the desires of photographers themselves. I argue
   that these tensions constitute a struggle over the social role of
   photography and its aesthetics aspirations, between individual and
   collective engagements with the medium and between forms of knowledge
   and the moral values that embed them, which went to the heart of social
   expectations of the medium.},

Abstract = {Photographic history took root in the discipline of art history with its
   focus on pictures, and subsequent critical histories have largely
   retained this image-centred focus. Yet there is no inherent reason why
   the study of photography needed to become a history of pictures
   especially, as in some respects the images might not be the most
   important aspect of the practice. In recent years there has been a
   flurry of studies examining aspects of photographic industry and
   business arrangements. In this article I present some debates from the
   field of academic business history, which raise issues of relevance for
   historians of photography. Reese V. Jenkins's influential study of
   Kodak, Image and Enterprise (1975), provides the opportunity for
   investigating some of these issues. A short conclusion on the English
   daguerreotype trade provides an illustration or coda to these themes.},

Abstract = {Mix Dupain is Australia's best-known modernist photographer. The
   least-known period of his working life is the Second World War, when he
   joined many other Australian artists and served as a camouflage officer
   for the Department of Home Security, attached to the Royal Australian
   Airforce. Dupain was trained in aerial photography. He camouflaged
   airbases in New South Wales and photographed camouflage experiments from
   the air. When the war moved into the SW Pacific region, Dupain was sent
   to Goodenough Island in Papua to work alongside Americans. This article
   addresses the emotional impact of the war on Dupain and contrasts the
   depersonalised, abstracted aesthetics of functional aerial camouflage
   photography with The New Guinea Series, a portfolio of documentary
   photographs of people and landscapes on the islands of New Guinea and
   Papua. Dupain's war service left him troubled and searching for greater
   truth through photography. I argue that The New Guinea Series, which was
   completed independently of Dupain's official employment as a camoufleur,
   communicates his sharpened awareness of the importance of embodiment as
   a moral approach to the world. I propose that the New Guinea Series
   acted as a humanist antidote to the dehumanisation that Dupain
   experienced through the abstractions of aerial pholography.},

Abstract = {This is a fragment of a book I am working on, written in the first
   instance against Roland Barthes's Camera Lucida. My opening claim is
   that the ongoing influence of the book has not been exhausted by
   readings that dwell on its lack of controlled argument or on its few
   moments of propositional clarity. I set out, therefore, to read as
   idiosyncratically and to write as strangely as Barthes himself. I argue
   that Barthes's sense of photography is too domestic, too much slanted to
   the vernacular, the poetic, the subjective, the native, the nostalgic,
   the anecdotal, the candid. I argue that his `pain' is not painful
   enough, that his sense of memory is too abstract and easy. For me the
   famous punctum is just a pinprick. I think the wound is much larger. As
   an art, photography insistently gives us the pain and the boredom of
   seeing, and the visual desperation that can follow: camera dolorosa. I
   am interested in another sense of photography that stresses its

Journal = {HISTORY OF PHOTOGRAPHY},

Volume = {42},

Pages = {239-248},
Abstract = {The Iwirakau Project was a collaboration that stretched from urban
   museums to remote rural marae-the meeting grounds constituted of
   buildings centred on carved houses in Maori communities-between a Maori
   writer and a Maori photographer both with tribal connections to Ngati
   Porou Tuturu on the East Coast of Te Ika-a-Maui (North Island) of
   Aotearoa (New Zealand). This area is referred to as Te Riu o Waiapu, the
   Waiapu Valley, named for the ancestral mother river, and home to many
   meeting houses carved by men trained in the Iwirakau tradition between
   1830 and 1930. This article examines the cultural guidance required to
   take the camera on to marae and into carved meeting houses to photograph
   ancestral places. Over the five-year span of working together, new ways
   of understanding Maori spiritual guardianship of images emerged,
   aligning with concepts of photographic sovereignty. In conjunction with
   elders, new tikanga (protocols) for the ethics of photographing, seeking
   permission, publishing, and returning research were developed. Through
   this process, three key Maori values whakapapa (genealogical
   connection), manaakitanga (hospitality), and rangatiratanga
   (sovereignty)-guided the project. In this article, Maori filmmaker Barry
   Barclay's conception of `camera as a friend' displaces Susan Sontag's
   idea of the camera as a weapon, arriving at a new proposition of the
   camera as part of the extended family.},

Abstract = {This article investigates late nineteenth-century Ottoman illustrated
   journals as a key site for the articulation of new, popular, and
   visualised forms of historical knowledge and sensibility in the imperial
   domain. Focusing on the reign of Sultan Abdulhamid II, a period from
   1876 to 1909 marked by the beginnings of print industry and rising
   levels of literacy in the Ottoman world, the article situates
   photography within a mixed, hybrid, and highly image-based media
   environment that radically transformed Ottoman modes of looking and
   remembering. Allowing new forms of reading, viewing, and popular
   participation, the journals helped refashion and pluralise collective
   images of the empire's material past. The article argues that the new
   visions of history and antiquity that emerged in the Ottoman journals
   were not merely an ideological package imposed by the state and
   passively consumed by the readers. The journals played an essential role
   in creating a highly visualised interface where popular and official
   forms of historical imagination mingled and interpenetrated.},

   as part of a strategy to create a distinctive group identity, not to be
   confused with the more established Surrealist movement. The conclusion
   compares Situationist and Surrealist uses of photography.},

Abstract = {Published posthumously, this article begins with a discussion of the
   historiography - and a related exhibition history - of the terms
   collage, photo-collage, and photomontage; and of the criteria that have
   been used to distinguish them as techniques, as visual idioms, and for
   their political implications and resonances as images of fine or applied
   art. The article then moves on to the work of two living artists who
   have been cutting and pasting photographs for more than forty years,
   Martha Rosler and John Stezaker, and the ambiguities of their being
   described as collagists, monteurs, or photomonteurs. In rethinking these
   categories, Evans argues for an expansive history of photomontage and
   collage that has continuing resonance today.},

Abstract = {When an anonymous German critic once referred to Peter Henry Emerson as
   the `Courbet of England', Emerson's photographic depictions of the lives
   of England's rural peasants could not have been far from mind. Despite
   this, many scholars have largely overlooked the social meaning Emerson
   ascribed to these peasant labourers, instead focusing on his more
   vociferously argued aesthetic programmes. The present article addresses
   the significance that England's peasantry had for Emerson, and the
   particular role photography played in the depiction of this social
   class. Through a more intertextual approach than has been undertaken in
   previous studies, I conclude that Emerson perceived the East Anglian
   peasantry as a paragon of natural, well-ordered labour, in contrast to
   the labour in disarray emerging in many colonial locales. Emerson
   represents, then, a peculiar kind of imperial subject, using photography
   to construct the imagery of well-ordered labour for a similarly
   positioned imperial audience. These claims are demonstrated through
   recourse to more recent photographic scholarship on the construction of
   historical imaginations, as well as little studied volumes from
   Emerson's oeuvre, such as his Cuban novel, Caoba, the Guerilla Chief.},

   went beyond mechanical recording. The series of images of Sorrento from
   Capodimonte confirms the strong connection between the formal research

   first to combine negatives to make views. Concerning Sommer, it was
   found that there exist several versions in different formats of the
   Sorrento views, obtained by different negatives carrying the images of
   foreground rocks and of the background.},

   mother, Agnes Rand Lee, in Gertrude Kasebier's composition, Blessed Art
   Thou among Women. Few may be aware that Francis Watts Lee was a

Volume = {33},

Abstract = {F. Holland Day has long been recognised as a pioneer American pictorial
   photographer and uncompromising advocate for photography as a fine art.
   His work, particularly his depictions of the male nude and the
   crucifixion of Christ (for which he was his own model), was somewhat
   controversial in his lifetime and remains influential. His advocacy
   culminated in the mounting of the all-important New School of American
   Photography exhibition in London and Paris more than a century ago.
   Thomas Langryl Harris, on the other hand, was primarily a painter of
   miniature portraits and had a questionable reputation. He led a short,
   tragic life and today is totally unknown in the art world. This article
   explores the relationship between F. Holland Day and Thomas Langryl
   Harris, the creation of a nude study of the young man by Day and its
   subsequent erroneous identification as a `study for the crucifixion'.},

Abstract = {This article, examining the circulation of prints, letters and ideas in
   the context of Pictorialism, deals with an ambitious but long-forgotten
   federation, the International Society of Pictorial Photographers.
   Founded in 1905 but almost immediately abandoned, this utopian project
   to simplify the organisation of international exhibitions did not alter
   the future of pictorial photography as it was intended to do. Studying
   its origins, creation and rules, and revealing the causes of its
   failure, this article sheds light on the politics of Pictorialism and
   examines one of its most ambivalent characteristics, namely the defence
   of national interests within a movement relying mostly on international
   collaboration. It also shows the central role played by Robert Demachy
   (1859-1936) and Alfred Stieglitz (1864-1946) in the matter. Despite its
   disappointing outcome, this story is that of a remarkable exchange of
   opinions, through sustained correspondence and texts, dealing mainly
   with the circulation of prints, among members of a global photographic
   network.},

Number = {2},
Pages = {160-176},
Month = {APR 3},
Abstract = {This article argues that body-camera relationships - issues of holding,
   mobility and display - informed the abstract qualities of some of Harry
   Callahan's early photographs from the 1940s. While these pictures have
   clear roots in earlier photographic precedents, they also engage
   problems related to those addressed by abstract painters of the same
   decade. The article positions Callahan's photographs as an independent
   contribution to this period's exploration of bodily experience and
   abstraction, but also suggests how camera-based photography from these

Abstract = {This article looks at Mexican photographer Graciela Iturbide's Cholos/as
   series taken on both sides of the border: in Los Angeles in 1986 and in
   Tijuana in 1989. The cholos/as, or gang members, have a complex
   relationship to Mexico; this response grows in part from the constructed
   nature of the border in general - a symbolic and relatively recent
   division between nations that does not represent lived reality or
   divisions between identities and cultures. As an outsider, Iturbide
   inserts visual cues throughout the series that tie the cholos/as'
   lifestyle to its Mexican roots and historical legacies, thus
   recuperating the mexicanidad, or Mexican identity, that exists in the
   borderlands. The narrative thrust of this series is strong,
   foregrounding female agency and matrilineal family structures over
   traditional, heteropatriarchal conceptions of family; complex
   negotiations of personal identity; and generally emphasising the social
   ties of border communities and subcultural groups through a distinct
   aesthetic style that intervenes in traditional photographic genres like
   studio portraiture. Iturbide's images form an origin story for the
   topicality of the US-Mexico border at the present moment and demonstrate
   that the issues of the border have been a critical point of inquiry for
   artists since the 1980s.},

Abstract = {This article examines the absence of atrocity in the photographic series
   The Course of History by the Belgian-born, New York-based photographer
   Bart Michiels (1964-). It shows, in beautiful, large-format prints,
   seemingly innocent landscapes and confined views of nature. Only when
   viewers read the titles of the photographs do they become aware of the
   violent history of the sites. These turn out to be the fields of fierce
   European battles such as Verdun, Waterloo and Stalingrad. The present
   article reviews recent trends towards using place as a motif in
   contemporary art photography and focuses on the `empty' landscape as a
   pictorial strategy that opens up a narrative space, one that needs to be
   completed by the viewer. The absence evoked by the image is treated as
   antithetical to the conventional ethos of photography, which canonically
   stands as the evidence of an occurrence.},

   present, all with an explicit relationship with Cezech Surrealist
   groups, whose work privileges the everyday environment as seen through a
   Surrealist lens. Images by Emila Medkova, Miroslav Hak, Vilem Reichmann

   distinctive interrogation of the `objective poetry' of its surroundings.},

   different historical periods. Ultimately, this paper raises questions
   about the critical stance of Del Tredici's photographs as they are
   republished in government reports and examines ways in which the meaning
   of his photographs responds to both Cold War and post-Cold War contexts.},

Abstract = {This article examines a photographic album compiled by an Irish
   Republican Army unit during the Irish War of Independence, a guerrilla
   struggle fought in Ireland from 1919 to 1921 between the Irish
   Republican Army and the British Army, along with the quasi-military
   Royal Irish Constabulary. The employment of techniques and surveillance
   methods similar to those of the British state and police forces in
   Ireland enabled the group's intelligence squad to track the movements of
   their enemies. Those depicted were monitored and sometimes targeted for
   elimination, thus turning this photographic evidence against the state
   and its representatives. The article is based on witness statements,
   memoirs and parliamentary proceedings, thus revealing the importance of
   photography in the intelligence war against the British Empire. Studio

Abstract = {This article explores what it means to write a cultural history of the
   flash gun, the apparatus used to explode flash powder between the late
   nineteenth and the mid twentieth centuries. Finding safer, more reliable
   ways to ignite magnesium and its compounds was a priority for over forty
   years for those photographers who wished to light up darkness, whether
   their field of operation was deep underground or in their own living
   rooms. The article argues that by paying attention to a piece of
   equipment used to create artificial light, rather than to more customary
   topics of photographic history, we can see the interdependence of the
   many different materials that come together in creating a photographic
   image, as well as the intersection of technology, inventor, and
   practitioner. Moreover, this focus underscores that when it comes to the
   history of the technology surrounding photography, invention,
   adaptation, and improvement are happening simultaneously on many fronts,
   with a loose network of practitioners - amateur and professional
   photographers, and employees of photographic companies - working in both
   competition and collaboration in their attempts to tame the
   unpredictability of compound flash powder.},

Journal = {HISTORY OF PHOTOGRAPHY},

Abstract = {European stereoscopic photography owes a significant part of its
   cultural specificity to amateur photographers who resorted to the wet
   collodion process to document nature with reduced exposure times and to
   perfect their photographic art with crisper and more detailed images.
   The Portuguese Carlos Relvas (1838-94) was one of these renowned
   collodion practitioners. Until recently, most of his stereoscopic
   collections remained undigitised and unstudied, and the contribution of
   stereoscopy to the launch of his international career was little known.
   The building of an online catalogue raisonne dedicated to Relvas's
   stereoscopic photography has been an opportunity to undertake a combined
   study of his stereoscopic negatives and prints, making it possible to
   retrieve new information about the extent, importance and evolution of
   his stereoscopic work. While designed to make these collections
   digitally available, the catalogue offers a new perspective on the
   specific value of stereoscopic negatives and cross-referenced `image
   families' for a new understanding of photographic practice. By
   re-examining the opportunities offered by digital collections, this
   article sheds light on their potential to remodel the memory and
   historic value of a nineteenth-century photographer and, in particular,
   to properly showcase stereoscopic photography.},

Volume = {36},
Number = {1},
Pages = {33-43},
Abstract = {With the rise of the art photography movement in Britain in the later
   nineteenth century came the need for a written discourse that would help
   promote the artistic merits of the medium. This article examines the
   development of this discourse by analysing early examples of
   photographic criticism, focusing on a serial publication entitled Sun
   Artists. Published in London between 1889 and 1891, each issue of Sun
   Artists contained photogravures of the work of a prominent photographer
   and an accompanying essay. An analysis of these texts sheds light on the
   challenges these essayists faced in their attempts to develop a critical
   framework for art photography, including grappling with the relationship
   between image and text, photographer and critic. This article explores
   the uncertainties manifest in Sun Artists about the role of written
   criticism in the art photography movement of the time.},

Abstract = {Focusing on the output of Elizabeth Howe Bliss, a Progressive Era
   travelling social worker, this article explores the snapshots Bliss made
   in New York City, Oklahoma and France. Although circulated in her own
   time, Bliss's images and their publication history have only recently
   been rediscovered. They deserve further analysis as they illuminate the
   practices of women using photography personally and professionally
   during the early decades of the twentieth century, and for their value
   to researchers of photographic history and beyond. This article argues
   for the importance of recirculating Bliss's snapshots - as well as other
   forms of vernacular imagery - through the digital dissemination made
   possible by platforming these photographic materials online within
   virtual spaces, and considers the specifics of one such platform, the

   in the town of Kumamoto, Kyushu prefecture. Four generations of the
   Tornishige family have operated the studio continuously since that time,
   creating a rare record of Japanese photographic history. The archives of
   the Tomishige Studio include studio equipment, photographs, and primary
   documents. Using this unique archive as a case study, this article
   considers the development of commercial photography within
   late-nineteenth-century Japan. Examining Tomishige's early business
   practices and working environment through these physical artifacts
   provides insight into both Tomishige's business and the broader world of
   early Japanese photography.},

   performance, of `play and prayer' - lent itself to the business of
   photographic studios and provided a rich backdrop to the dynamic
   production and consumption of photographic objects that were unlike

Abstract = {The Lima-born photographer Manuel Gonzalez Salazar documented the
   colonial architectural heritage of his native city, as well as other
   major Peruvian cities such as Cusco, Arequipa, Ayacucho, Cajamarca and
   Trujillo. Just as Eugene Atget had documented the old Paris that he saw
   gradually disappearing, Gonzalez Salazar chose to photograph the
   architectural and artistic heritage of the colonial era, which dominated
   the urban environment of the Peru of his day, but which was threatened
   by modernisation and social change. Like Atget in the French context,
   Gonzalez Salazar is an anomaly in the history of Peruvian
   twentieth-century photography, which is best known on the international
   stage for indigenismo and the depiction of pre-Hispanic customs. The
   rediscovery of Gonzalez Salazar's work invites scholars to pay greater
   attention to the cultural heritage of the colonial era, as well as to
   the archives that documented it in all its splendour.},

Abstract = {This article examines the activities of the photographers James
   Robertson and Felice Beato in the Crimean War, with particular reference
   to the marketing of their work among the stationed forces and the
   Anglo-French public at home. Drawing primarily on the correspondence of
   the French artist Jean-Charles Langlois, this study emphasizes the
   important contribution of Robertson's assistant Felice Beato in the
   production of the Crimean series and the formative impact of these
   experiences on his training as a war photographer. Langlois's
   correspondence supports the re-attribution of several photographs of the
   Crimea to Felice Beato, constituting the earliest known works credited
   to this photographer. In their subsequent travels to Malta and
   Jerusalem, Robertson and Beato's professional relationship underwent
   rapid transformation, reflecting the complexity of their collaboration
   and the difficulties of approaching nineteenth-century travel
   photographers in isolation from their professional colleagues and
   rivals.},

Abstract = {This study analyses the various contributions of the Angio-Australian
   merchant Samuel Cocking to the photographic community of
   nineteenth-century Japan. It argues for his central role in the
   importation and supply of photographic goods, the promotion of a local
   manufacturing industry, the founding of informal learned societies, and
   the general advancement of the technology in Japan. Contrary to recent
   studies that have tended to separate the careers of foreign
   photographers active in Japan front their Japanese counterparts, this
   study argues that any such approach misrepresents the everyday
   interaction and proximity of the two groups. The author aims to
   emphasise the significance of informed, long-term foreign expatriates as
   cultural advisers and supporters of the local photographic community. In
   so doing, this study questions the application of recent critical
   approaches that have emphasised the camera's role as a technology of
   colonial expansion and cultural imperialism. Instead, the essay
   highlights the importance of photography as a shared interest and
   passion of foreign and Japanese practitioners that Could promote
   dialogue and mutual awareness across Cultures.},

Abstract = {This article is concerned with the essential paradox of cinematography,
   a serial phenomenon that has as its goal the creation of an illusion of
   continuity and unity from diversity and multiplicity. It is concerned
   fundamentally with the dialectical movement in cinematography from one
   to many and from there to a new unity. The author argues that there
   existed a similar tension in early photography, which Sought initially
   to isolate a single `virtual' image of reality from a myriad of images.
   Joseph Nicephore Niepce's photograph showing the view from a window at
   his country estate of Le Gras was in reality a series of superimposed
   images, a palimpsest reflecting the passage of the time during the
   day-long exposure. The chronophotography of Etiemie-Jules Marey and of
   Eadweard Muybridge extends the single/multiple dialectic and leads to a
   discussion of Louis Lumiere's short film of 1895 La Sortie des usines
   Lumiere (Workers Leaving the Lumiere Factory) as a paradigm of
   cinematography's creation of unity from multiplicity. The discussion is
   extended finally to consider the construction of an early Lumiere
   programme at the Grand Cafe, Boulevard des Capucines, Paris, in December
   1898.},

   of African Photographers},
Journal = {HISTORY OF PHOTOGRAPHY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {38},
Number = {1},
Pages = {21-39},
Abstract = {Of the myriad analytical approaches to photography and its practices in
   colonial Africa, the perspective most often muted is that of black
   African photographers who were among the most numerous and prolific
   producers of these early image-objects. The lack of attention to their
   activities represents a glaring omission in photographic histories of
   the continent and further evidence of the legacies of silence
   perpetuated by the colonial project. As a consequence, there are
   undeniable archival difficulties in recuperating the lives and careers
   of black African photographers. However, these photographers are
   important actors worthy of the effort because of their level of
   immersion within the geographies and processes of visual economies of
   this formative period. Using Gold Coast-born and Lagos-based Neils
   Walwin Holm as a case in point, this article explores how black African
   photographers not only produced image-objects for their clients, but
   used their photographic oeuvres, practices and networks to advance their
   own personal ambitions, professional careers and social reputations.
   Ultimately, this article underscores the need for greater breadth and
   depth of scholarship on these early colonial-era African photographers -
   invisible black actors who were essential contributors to the history of
   photography in Africa.},

Journal = {HISTORY OF PHOTOGRAPHY},

Volume = {40},
Number = {4},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Characterised by their determination to get close to the action, the
   Australian combat cameramen of the Second World War made a significant
   contribution to the evolution of the war photographer into the dynamic
   figure familiar today. This is especially true of their intimate
   documentation of the vicious encounter with the Japanese in New Guinea
   and other islands of the Southwest Pacific, which went beyond
   professional bravery. A large corps of official photographers shooting
   for both government and military agencies expressed the racial ideology
   of a war fought against an opponent who was increasingly loathed as the
   war progressed. Their pictures of Australian triumphs over the Japanese,
   including graphic and often deliberately demeaning pictures of dead and
   captured enemy, reflected the exigencies of wartime propaganda. But they
   also expanded on a frame of cultural reference derived from decades of
   anxiety about the threat of invasion by Japan, and reveal an abiding
   national view of the battlefield as the definitive arena for a contest
   of rival masculinities. Australia's war in the Pacific has attracted
   increasing scholarly and popular attention in recent years. However, the
   enormous archive of official photographs has been largely ignored,
   except as a source of illustrative material. This article argues that
   the archive needs to be read as a collective text in its own right, for
   the significant insight it provides into Australian cultural as well as
   military and geopolitical insecurities.},

Abstract = {Official Australian photography of the military occupation of postwar
   Japan provides a significant modern case study of photography as a
   medium of neo-colonial and Orientalist representation. Asserting its
   dominance of the combined British Commonwealth Occupation Force
   supporting the Americans, the Australian military revelled in the role
   of occupier of a wartime enemy who was still widely loathed. Sometimes
   compared with the British Raj in Imperial India, the Occupation became a
   historically familiar exercise of the white man's power and privilege
   over the conquered and colonised Asiatic. It was marked by the rituals
   and practices of tourism, including the taking of photographic images.
   Photography was the main medium by which the event was recorded and
   circulated to the public back in Australia. Keen to convey images of a
   force enjoying the privileges of victory while in firm control of a
   still distrusted people, official photographers affiliated with the
   Australian military sought to capture a picturesque, feminised and
   ``traditional' Japan. This was a Japan that the war had made obsolete
   and which the Occupation was intended to modernise. The photographic
   appropriation of Japan reveals the ambiguity of the Occupation project,
   and the shallowness of Orientalist representation more generally.},

Journal = {HISTORY OF PHOTOGRAPHY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {38},
Number = {1},
Pages = {56-72},
Abstract = {Emil Otto Hoppe established himself as the leading producer of
   photographic portraits in Edwardian London, a position he augmented
   until the mid-1920s. Particular aesthetic, psychological and
   philosophical ideas undergirded his practices - practices which, in some
   respects, were then unconventional. His portrait work helped him to
   achieve some celebrity as an influential cultural figure, and this
   status in turn advanced his career as a portrait maker. Three important
   determinants of Hoppe's portrait output are identified and elaborated
   upon: `The Maker' (Hoppe himself); `Patronage' (the actual or assumed
   demands of customers, including sitters); and - an entity that is less
   easy to define - `The Public'. Hoppe claimed, of certain eminent
   figures, that he had made `the recognised face', and the sense of public
   recognition here implies that the likeness must combine intense insight
   with extensive circulation in the illustrated press. Viewed in
   retrospect, the range of Hoppe's portraits - from such leading
   politicians as Philip Snowden, through such society beauties as Lady
   Hazel Lavery, to artists, including Jacob Epstein and Rudyard Kipling -
   punctuated a particular period of history, the cultural moment at which
   emerging aspects of twentieth-century modernity could be discerned.
   Exemplary in this respect, despite its unusual collage nature, is
   Hoppe's depiction of the Italian Futurist Filippo Tommaso Marinetti.},

Abstract = {The essay explores the reception of early scientific photography through
   an examination of the work of John William Draper (1811-82). Throughout
   the 1840s, Draper - a chemist and trained medical doctor - used the
   daguerreotype as a tool to investigate various philosophical and
   scientific questions pertaining to the nature of light. While Draper
   sought both US and European audiences for his work, his focus on the
   process of the daguerreotype, rather than the results of that process,
   in addition to the unsettled terrain of the sciences and of the
   photograph itself during this period, caused many of his accomplishments
   to remain unknown by his contemporaries.},

Abstract = {In the mid-1870s, Robert Crawshay started a now-forgotten contest
   designed to promote the development of direct life-size photography in
   Britain and the advent of a more objective photographic portrait. The
   contest saw much enthusiasm and many entries, but, as this article
   argues, ultimately ended up setting back the very causes it sought to
   advance. The competition shone a spotlight on problems with focus, tone,
   and especially scale when it came to the `life-size' direct portrait,
   and it managed to promote the role of subjectivity and the superiority
   of enlargement instead of its preferred ends.},

Abstract = {In the middle of the nineteenth century, a number of photographers
   produced boldly geometrical images of urban spaces, engineering and
   buildings, drawing attention to the abstract shapes discerned in what
   was depicted. Among those were Juan (Jean) Laurent and his collaborators
   and successors. The images sold by Laurent y Cia (Laurent \& Co.)
   provide a significant example of how such geometrical obsessions could
   be connected to cultural translation, as we would now term it. Lee
   Fontanella has argued that Laurent `sensed it was his mission to record
   photographically and to register in an orderly fashion all minutiae, as
   well as monuments, in the peninsula'. By providing such renderings in a
   reproducible form, Laurent made a version of those things available to
   people abroad, in other parts of Spain, and, of course, to those in the
   locality that was depicted. The geometrical shapes in which the images
   are cast are a key means through which those things are communicated.
   The present study argues that geometry is presented as a kind of
   universal language through which photography can `speak' and attempts a
   reconstruction of how such a geometrical photographic language might
   have been thought to operate. In these respects it contributes to the
   renewed critical interest in the historical notion of photography as a
   universal language.},

Journal = {HISTORY OF PHOTOGRAPHY},

Volume = {36},
Number = {3},
Pages = {265-274},
Abstract = {This article proposes a relationship between the subject matter of the
   dead and the vehicle of stereography in American Civil War photography.
   In addition, it suggests a set of parallel oppositions between repulsion
   as compared with attraction and between Barthes's `reality effect' and a
   known illusion created by mechanical means. Civil War photographs
   commanded attention but repulsed with their horrific subject matter.
   Although stereography gave a convincing impression of three dimensions,
   viewers were aware of the mechanics generating this illusion. It appears
   that being aware of the nature of the optical device producing the
   illusion provided a buffer against the terrible nature of these images.},

Abstract = {This paper reviews the work of two photographers of Lucknow: Ahmad Ali
   Khan (active 1850s-1862) and Abbas Ali (active late 1860s-c.1880). Both
   photographers recorded the people and places of the city. Khan, closely
   connected to the Awadhi royal family, documented the architecture of the
   city before and after the 1857 Uprising. He also made portraits of
   members of the royal family and of residents of the European community
   in Lucknow. Abbas Ali published The Lucknow Album (1874), a volume of
   fifty architectural photographs. Ali's other photography concerned the
   taluqdars of Awadh and the nautch women of Lucknow. Situating the work
   of Khan and Ali within a complex history of cultural exchange, the
   author considers their photography as the visual representation of
   attitudes towards the contested spaces of the city.},

Abstract = {This essay traces the professional trajectory of N. W. Holm, the
   pre-eminent photographer of Lagos, West Africa, from the 1890s until
   1910. He then trained as a barrister in London and established law
   chambers in Lagos in 1918, despite having extolled the virtues of
   photography as a profession. This was at a time of increasing exclusion
   and discrimination of Africans by colonial administrations in West
   Africa. Holm had been present at the first Pan-African conference, held
   in London in 1900, and was appointed as secretary to represent Lagos
   Colony for the first Pan-African Association that was a product of it.
   Around 1903/04 he instituted a commercial postcard archive that
   documented a trajectory of Lagosian modernity and cosmopolitanism that
   both had preceded and sought to undermine the colonial ideologies of
   scientific racism and primitivism to which the colonial government and a
   new influx of Europeans subscribed.},

   aristocrats Adam and Katarzyna Potocki of their journey to Egypt, the
   Holy Land and Istanbul in 1852 and 1853. The album, which is now in the
   National Library of Poland, consists of thirty-three calotype prints by
   three different photographers. The author discusses the album and its
   depiction of the Middle East in the first period of photography in the
   region. The article describes the processes by which the photographs
   were made, pointing out differences in the photographers' methods and
   the consequences of these differences for the aesthetic values of the
   photographs. It describes the working processes of each photographer and
   demonstrates three different methods of photographing the Middle East in
   the mid-nineteenth century.},

Abstract = {In 1952, Edward Steichen made an extensive European tour in preparation
   for the exhibition The Family of Mail (1955). The goal of the trip was
   to contact European photographers, inform them about the forthcoming
   exhibition and collect photographs for possible inclusion in the
   exhibition. Based oil archival sources and oral interviews, this paper
   discusses the rationale, strategy and results of the trip, including the
   Museum of Modern Art exhibition, Post-War European Photography (1953).
   Insight into the formation of the Family of Mali is gained by comparing
   the photograph-gathering strategies Steichen used in Europe with those
   used later in the United States.},

Abstract = {Paper photography and paper money share a common history, especially in
   the context of the USA in the 1860s, a commonality explored by this
   article. The interconnection of the two media was first addressed by
   Oliver Wendell Holmes's metaphorical description of cartes de visite as
   `sentimental ``green-backs{''} of civilization'. This article focuses on
   Abraham Lincoln's public image as presidential candidate, one that was
   heavily influenced by the new craze for cartes de visite. At the same
   time, the advent of modern paper money as we know it is marked by the
   introduction of Demand Notes or so-called greenbacks, of which the
   ten-dollar denomination showed Lincoln's portrait after a photograph.
   Medial intersections between paper money and photography are taken into
   consideration in more theoretical terms, before a concluding section
   sets out the wider context of photography's involvement in the emergence
   and early turbulences of early national paper currencies in the Civil
   War era.},

Abstract = {From her early photographs of the ruinous aftermath of the Lebanon War
   in Beirut (1982) to her more recent images of bomb craters in Eleven
   Blowups (2006), the French artist Sophie Ristelhueber has been intent to
   maintain, in her own metaphor, `the analytical distance of an anatomy
   lesson'. Exhibiting the evidence of warfare but withholding their
   explanation, Ristelhueber's provocative gesture of making art of war,
   removing human conflicts from their political contexts to render them as
   still-lifes, ready-mades, earthworks, or surrealist poems, is patently
   anti-journalistic. In keeping with the artist's surgical analogy, this
   article explores Ristelhueber's aesthetic mode of address as one that
   shares its fundamental operation with that of photography - namely, to
   make a cut. Retracing the morphology of recurring imprints and injuries
   that appear across the terrestrial and corporeal expanses traversed in
   her work, the article considers the ways in which these cuts pertain to
   the transformative power of violence and images alike.},

Volume = {42},

Pages = {146-167},
Abstract = {Spirit photographs are joint portraits that visually unite the bereaved
   and the deceased without use of a corpse. Arising from the same ideas
   that founded Spiritualism in the nineteenth century, these enchanted
   mementos are said to have been discovered by William H. Mumler in 1861,
   in Boston, Massachusetts. Spirit photographers typically worked with
   mediums who enabled the appearance of magical extras' of the deceased,
   and as the majority of mediums were women, their contributions to this
   development within personal mourning rituals have been limited almost
   exclusively to this activity. Fuelled by the acknowledged proximity of
   two women to the invention, Helen F. Stuart and Hannah Frances Green,
   this article challenges Mumler's widely accepted status as the
   originator of spirit photography. Although Stuart was the owner of the
   studios where Mumler stumbled upon his invention and Green was a
   secretary and medium in the same studios, scholars have tended to refuse
   these women larger roles. This article establishes the viability of a
   new narrative, presenting the strong likelihood that these women were in
   fact one and the same person and proposing that this woman be recognised
   as a pioneer of spirit photography.},

Abstract = {Ansel Adams and Georgia O'Keeffe, although committed realist artists
   using straightforward photographic technique and an objective style of
   painting, transfigured the natural scene artistically to express
   profoundly metaphysical responses to nature. Both Adams and O'Keeffe
   were aware of manifold currents of mystical thought in the 1930s through
   personal contact with the theosophical teachers A. R. Orage and Jean
   Toomer. Treating landscape features as psychological and spiritual
   phenomena, they shared a lifelong quest for creative development and
   self-discovery through the forms of nature.},

Abstract = {Ansel Adams's photographic career was paralleled by his desire to
   achieve the finest quality of photomechanical reproduction of his images
   for his many fine printed books. For thirty years, he relied upon
   letterpress halftone to recreate the aesthetic effect of his `f/64'
   style. In the 1960s, as letterpress for photographic reproduction was
   phased out by most commercial printers, George Waters introduced Adams
   to the new technology of offset lithography. Together, they formed a
   highly successful collaboration as artist and master printer from 1969
   to 1979.},

Abstract = {As photography was taken up in the entrepots of nineteenth-century west
   Africa, among them Cape Coast and Accra, it became a primary mode of
   portraiture. When considered alongside colonial-era holdings in European
   and US archives, historical photograph collections in families in Ghana
   suggest that photography's emergence cannot be separated from a range of
   other emerging and far-reaching creative modernisms. These portraits
   entail aspects of ceremonial debut spectacles, political ascendancy
   rites, and the visuality of decorum in larger public performances. From
   the medium's inception, photographs have been held and kept as enduring
   objects; at the same time, they are the layered products of multiple
   formal, aesthetic, temporal and conceptual interventions in a range of
   media, only some of which are the work of a camera.},

Abstract = {Recent theoretical work on the Mediterranean has emphasised the sea as
   an agent of `connectivity' over a highly fragmented space, bringing
   peoples, goods, languages, and ideas into contact. Early photography in
   the Mediterranean manifests this connectivity and mixedness across the
   whole field of its practice: among photographers, sitters, printers,
   dealers, consumers, patrons, and even the photographs themselves.
   Focusing on the eastern Mediterranean, this article treats early
   photography in its `Mediterranean' context: located within a space of
   multiple languages, ethnicities, and religions, of personal and
   commercial networks between cities and across borders, and of spatial
   and social circulation and exchange. Such an approach complicates the
   two prevailing scholarly narratives of Mediterranean photography: one
   based on place, nationality, or ethnicity; the other on Orientalism.
   Seen in this light, the early history of photography in the
   Mediterranean may have implications for understanding the ways in which
   modernisation took hold and operated in the region.},

Abstract = {On 25 March 1931 nine young African Americans were arrested in Alabama
   for the alleged rape of two White women, nearly lynched, sentenced to
   death and eventually incarcerated for years. This article examines the
   arrest photograph of the Scottsboro Nine and enacts a `social biography'
   in exploring its conflicting uses in American media. The article
   proposes that it is an `averted lynching photograph' that echoes images
   of actual lynch mob killings. Southern newspapers used leading captions
   with encoded racial hierarchies that framed the Nine as violators of
   White womanhood. Conversely, radical media reframed the photograph,
   arguing that a `frame-up' trial constituted a `legal lynching'. The
   Communist organisation International Labor Defense led the campaign to
   acquit the defendants, and its magazine Labor Defender reproduced the
   photograph extensively in polemical photomontages. Diverse uses in
   African American media varied from analogous captioning in the combative
   Chicago Defender to its pertinent absence in the National Association
   for the Advancement of Colored People's forum The Crisis. Many of these
   media framings fostered the abjection and victimhood of the Nine,
   whether in condemnation or sympathy. The photograph was a site of
   contestation of conflicting values concerning race, in which the
   subjects had little agency.},

Abstract = {In 1973, a Toronto magazine published the photographic bookOpen
   Passportby Montreal photographer John Max. A formally innovative
   narrative sequence about the dissolution of an artist's marriage, it has
   been a touchstone of Canadian photography since its publication.
   Simultaneously autobiographical, fictional, and experimental,Open
   Passportis a unique response to the representations of self and
   subjectivity in American photography of the 1970s, which championed the
   idea of photographers as authors and the book as privileged support for
   their images. Initially produced as an exhibition accompanied by a
   slideshow,Open Passportis a work that uses multiple supports for
   disseminating a photographic narration about the self. Using previously
   unavailable materials from John Max's archives, this article argues that
   these different supports should be considered as multiple variants of a
   single work, which upsets the hierarchical logic distinguishing original
   works from adaptations or derived works. This has important
   methodological consequences for the emerging field of photobook studies,
   which has given primacy to the history of books over that of
   exhibitions. The notion of performance is used to explain the
   relationship between the work and its supports, showing in turn the
   importance of the processes of editing and sequencing in the definition
   of the photographic work of art.},

Abstract = {Over the past thirty years, the city as represented by art photography
   has been shown as progressively empty and alienating. While the
   emptiness of nineteenth-century streets was due to the limitations of
   photographic technology, it was actively pursued as a formal device by
   the New Topographics photographers. Recent art photography shows an even
   more pronounced trend towards showing the city as vacant. This contrasts
   starkly with the densely populated, bustling, urban environments typical
   of twentieth-century street photography. This essay argues that images
   of an empty contemporary city can be understood as a symptom of
   disciplinary relations internal to photography as an art form, and as a
   consequence of art photography's distancing of itself from vernacular
   representations of the city when the distinction between art photography
   and vernacular photography is at risk of collapsing. Empty urban images
   tell us about modes of experience in the contemporary city and about
   photography itself. This essay uses the trope of the banal as a way of
   locating the extreme form of the everyday' that typifies the
   contemporary photographic discourse of the street. Philip-Lorca diCorcia
   and Melanie Manchot both address the everyday street as an acute site
   for understanding the negotiation of public space and contemporary
   experiences of the city. Both refer to yet go beyond the dichotomy of
   the city as empty or full and reveal a different set of relations to the
   street through photography.},

Abstract = {This paper aims to show that vernacular photography contributed Subtly
   to changing the manner in which Impressionist painters depicted
   landscape and the human figure. This new way of approaching reality can
   be discerned only for a very brief period in Impressionism, between 1865
   and 1880, although signs of the impact of photography on painting are
   already to be seen in Daguerreotypes of the 1840s. The influence of
   photography becomes most striking after 1859, with the production of
   stereoscopic views of human figures oil the boulevards and elsewhere.
   painters never explicitly acknowledged these influences, however, and it
   may be that these influences were assimilated Unconsciously in part.},

Abstract = {In his 1933 book La Trace de Rome dans le desert de Syrie, Antoine
   Poidebard, the Jesuit missionary, French spy, colonial servant, air
   force officer, and archaeologist, published 219 aerial photographs of
   archaeological remnants in the Syrian steppe, which he identified as
   pertaining to the ancient Roman limes. This article examines Poidebard's
   photographic reconfiguration of historical time and geographical space
   in the context of archaeology and historiography in Mandate Syria and
   Lebanon. The article argues that, in the absence of the archaeological
   groundwork that they were allegedly meant to enable, his photographs
   combined the appeal of a visible past with the promise of that past's
   potential future as an object of investigation. In the transitory and
   politically precarious situation of the Mandate, the rare record
   constituted by these photographs upheld a projected connection between
   ancient Roman and modern French civilisation in the geographical region
   of the Mandate.},

   as a technology of violence by the Qajar autocracy in the late
   nineteenth century and its use as a technology of evidence following the
   police reforms in the early twentieth century. Frequently used prior to
   imminent execution, photographs of prisoners became a ritual within the
   violent regime: a performative act associated with death and dying.
   Thus, prisoner photography correlated with the earlier body-centred
   forms of chastisement and torture in Qajar society that were abounded
   from the public spaces after several penal reforms. It was only in the
   wake of the broad-reaching police reforms in the 1910s that a universal
   system of judicial photography as instructed by Alphonse Bertillon was
   established, epitomising the ostensive aspects of the global mobility
   and circulation of technologies, methods and expertise. Thus, the
   practice of photographing prisoners lays bare unique insights into the
   judicial and penal systems of Qajar Iran and their ensuing
   transformation as part of modernisation and the formation of
   nation-building.},

Abstract = {Although very short-lived, the Colorsnap process, promoted in 1928-29 by
   the small British company Colour Snapshots (1928) Ltd, is mentioned in
   several histories of colour photography processes as a key example of a
   false start in colour photography. Such accounts emphasise problems with
   technical quality and poor industrial organisation, but miss the key
   role of the market in patents and changes in investment practices in the
   period. From 1926 to 1929, the London Stock Exchange saw a frenzy of
   speculative investment in companies touting new innovations in media,
   linked to gramophone, radio, cinema, photography and photo-telegraphy.
   Like most of these companies, Colour Snapshots was inexperienced and
   completely dependent on the success of an untested patent. The company
   promoter deployed the then-common strategy of underpricing, consequently
   the company was undercapitalised and unable to finance production.
   Colour Snapshots was liquidated in the Great Slump of 1929-33. This
   article situates it in wider cultures of the market, in cultural
   practices of invention, and ideologies of modernity and innovation. It
   argues that the rise and fall of Colorsnap expresses the opportunistic
   practices of invention and speculative finance of the time.},

Abstract = {This article examines nineteenth-century photographs of the
   archaeological site of Magnesia on the Meander, focusing on the work of
   Alexander Svoboda in the 1860s and that of a German archaeological team
   who excavated there in the 1890s. While a brief archaeological campaign
   was undertaken at Magnesia in the 1840s, by the 1860s, when Svoboda took
   his photograph, the site was abandoned and unstudied. Through an
   investigation of both the career of Svoboda and the history of
   archaeological photography in the region, this article places Svoboda's
   photography in the larger context of investigation at Magnesia. It
   argues that Svoboda's photograph of Magnesia was part of his most
   important project, a book of photographs and an accompanying exhibition
   on the Seven Churches of Asia. Svoboda's inclusion of Magnesia within
   this project exposed the site to a much larger audience, and influenced
   how the site was viewed and understood. This photograph, therefore,
   represents a turning point in the history of this site, leading to the
   eventual recovery and study of this important classical city under the
   German excavators, and their own photographic recording of the city's
   classical ruins.},

Abstract = {This article examines German colonial cultures in the post-World War I
   period following Germany's loss of a colonial empire. Photography had
   long been embedded in both the practical and ideological production of
   empire, but after 1918 took on an especially significant role in
   constructing a surrogate colony' that kept the colonial idea alive in
   the absence of direct colonial rule. The dynamics of this surrogate
   colony are especially evident in the publications of the organised
   colonial movement. Drawing on these publications, I argue that the
   colonial movement produced a surrogate colony that was as much about the
   management of gendered and racialised German populations as it was about
   propagandising for a return to colonial rule. Photography played a key
   role in bringing together two areas that underlay this gendered and
   racialised dynamic: science and commercial culture. I thus begin by
   tracing the way in which photographic scientific cultures, in particular
   in the fields of medicine, anthropology, and racial science, shaped the
   contours of the surrogate colony. These scientific cultures emerged in
   an unstable relationship with mass commercial photographic cultures,
   with the article then turning to an exploration of colonial fashion
   photography'. The foregrounding of clothing and bodies in this
   photography highlights the complex relationship between scientific and
   commercial photography, which is shown to be deeply implicated in the
   production of racialised and gendered forms of embodiment.},

Abstract = {The arrival of police radio inaugurated a vast and punitive new media
   ecology. Between the 1920s and the 1950s the installation and
   implementation of police radio systems - now ubiquitous and utterly
   naturalised - in towns and cities across the USA restructured the
   practice of policing and the experience of being policed. These
   processes radically revised the social, psycho-geographic and
   spatiotemporal relations unfolding amid the new medium's localised
   atmospheres of broadcast, reception and swift weaponised response. Image
   makers working in a range of media, including painters and news
   photographers, operated within this atmosphere. Positing police radio as
   a vital and violent representational infrastructure, this article tracks
   its technological reordering of municipal space as tactical policed
   space, both as this space was given to appear in Municipal Law
   Enforcement, a large oil painting created circa 1950 by Kansas City
   police officer Charles M. `Pat' Murray for his department, and as this
   painting was reproduced, and its signal thereby amplified
   photographically, both locally and nationally by daily newspapers.},

Abstract = {This article examines the visual culture of late nineteenth-century
   Japan through portrait photographs, paintings, and prints depicting
   Emperor Meiji (1852-1912), the country's first constitutional monarch.
   Four official portrait photographs, produced between 1872 and 1888,
   promoted his new image as the leader of Japan's modernisation and the
   divine descendent of the Sun Goddess. Photography embodied the accuracy
   of vision that was non-existent in Japanese art and was therefore
   considered perfect for giving authenticity to his dual image. The
   emperor's photographs also served as the model for numerous popular
   prints as well as official and unofficial portrait paintings. Thanks to
   these images, which broke the long-standing taboo about portraying the
   emperor, Meiji's likeness circulated to people of all walks of life. The
   last official portrait (1888) became known as goshin'ei (venerable true
   shadow) and the quintessential icon of the sovereign. It was distributed
   to public schools to be worshipped by students on special occasions.
   Although it was a photographic reproduction of a conte crayon drawing,
   the state treated it as an authentic photograph and required schools to
   handle it as a sacred object. This series of portraits, which clearly
   etched the emperor's image in the Japanese mind, reveals the significant
   transformation of Japanese vision during the late nineteenth century.},

Abstract = {Taking its point of departure from the current digitisation of the
   Harvard Astronomical Plate Collection, this article follows the plates
   back to the time when the status of photography as a research tool for
   astronomers was still to be established. It focuses on Charles S.
   Peirce, who, while employed by the US Coast Survey, made astronomical
   observations and contributed to the deliberation over visual and
   photographic methods. Particular attention is paid to Peirce's
   involvement in early explorations of photography's potential as a
   measurement tool. The guiding assumption is that approaching photography
   as a tool, rather than as a sign or representation, offers new inroads
   into the old problem of photography's revealing powers and its capacity
   to serve as a means of discovery in science. Drawing on Peirce's
   scientific practice as an alternative resource for theory construction,
   this article contributes to the ongoing efforts to conceptualise the
   productive or generative dimension of photographic methods. It concludes
   by pointing to the diagrammatic notion of evidence developed late in
   Peirce's philosophical career, proposing that photography be reconceived
   as a diagrammatic tool.},

Abstract = {This article explores memory, photography and atrocity in the aftermath
   of war. It takes as its case study the controversies surrounding the
   February 1945 firebombing of Dresden. One photograph in particular has
   become the iconic image of the firebombing and of the devastating air
   war more generally - Richard Peter's View from the City Hall Tower to
   the South of 1945. Although arguably less divided today than it was
   during the Cold War, when the image became seared into local and
   national memory, Germany's past continues to haunt everyday discourse
   and political action in the new millennium, creating new ruptures in a
   deeply fractured public sphere. By examining the historical context for
   the photograph's creation and its dissemination through the book Dresden
   - A Camera Accuses, this article raises questions of responsibility,
   victimhood and moral obligation that are at the heart of bearing witness
   to wartime trauma. Peter's Dresden photographs have long intervened in
   that existential difficulty and will probably continue to do so for the
   foreseeable future.},

Journal = {HISTORY OF PHOTOGRAPHY},

Volume = {35},

Pages = {33-43},
Abstract = {This article engages the question of expanded photography through a
   study of Nancy Davenport's 2008 piece Blast-off Animation, part of her
   multichannel DVD installation WORKERS (Leaving the Factory). The piece
   comprises digital photo-montages, `collages made up of hundreds of still
   images - then animated in very basic ways'. In this, post-production has
   become the principal site of photographic image production. Recorded and
   calculated images are merged into augmented documents that no longer
   display an (impossible) past, but a possible present. Digitally animated
   into moving stills, and displayed in the form of continuous loops, these
   images meet less a desire for movement than a desire for (spatial and
   temporal) endlessness. In including within the frame the endlessness
   beyond the frame, expanded photography overcomes the spatial and
   temporal confinement of the still - but in so doing confines photography
   within its supposed deficiency. By following the conceptual and
   strategic threads - and pitfalls - of expanded photography, the present
   essay seeks to clear the way for a new, fluctuating temporality of
   images - a photographic now.},

   examines images by Man Ray and others in terms of their relation to

Abstract = {In the second half of the nineteenth century, the Montefiores were an
   international Jewish family including prominent bankers, insurers, and
   merchants. Four brothers of the family were also leading members of the
   amateur photography movement in Britain, Belgium, France, and Australia.
   An album containing photography now in the State Library of New South
   Wales in Sydney, but made by Eliezer Levi Montefiore in the Colony of
   Victoria, reveals aspects of his family's identity. The album reflects
   their role in the British colonisation of Australia, as well as their
   interest in the development of Australian national identity. The
   enthusiasm for photography manifest in the album was shared by the
   brothers across national borders, and so also reflects their
   transnational, diasporic experience. Furthermore, the album represents
   aspects of the family's class and gender identities, and functioned as a
   kind of visual primer for its recipient, Eliezer's young daughter,
   Caroline.},

Title = {Rural Labour: Photographic Representation of the English Countryside in
   the 1930s Socialist Press},
Journal = {HISTORY OF PHOTOGRAPHY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {35},
Number = {1},
Pages = {59-75},
Abstract = {The popular socialist press of 1930s Britain was pioneering in its use
   of photographic imagery in news publication. Both the Daily Herald and
   Weekly Illustrated (later simply Illustrated) were established as
   socialist publications, owned by and overtly in support of the Labour
   party of the day. The photographic archive for these publications is
   held at the National Media Museum, Bradford (UK), and includes a section
   on Agriculture. Drawing on material from the archive, this paper
   examines photographic representations of the countryside and rural
   issues in these publications and interrogates their political and
   ideological underpinnings. Sources for a socialist imagining of the
   countryside are investigated and the ideological and political positions
   of the British Labour movement in the 1930s are considered to explain
   Labour conceptions of the countryside and to explore how these positions
   may be reflected in the photographic press directly under Labour
   influence or control. Changes in photographic technology and the
   photo-journalistic practice of the period are reviewed in the light of
   the archive evidence and assessed for their effect on representations of
   the countryside and their implications for a more general cultural and
   social understanding of rural experience.},

Journal = {HISTORY OF PHOTOGRAPHY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {42},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {249-268},
Abstract = {From the moment small consumer cameras became available in Australia in
   the early twentieth century, Ngarrindjeri people embraced photography as
   a means to record their history, and represent their families, aesthetic
   traditions, and worldviews against the perilous times of attempted
   assimilation by the state, including the rampant forced removal of
   Aboriginal children that came to be known as the Stolen Generations. In
   analysing a collection of rare historical photographs from this period,
   taken by Ngarrindjeri photographers and retained in Ngarrindjeri
   families, we bring the perspectives of contemporary Ngarrindjeri Elders
   to bear. Significantly, the photographs can be observed to operate both
   as a rich counter archive to colonial representation and settler memory,
   and as esteemed cultural objects capable of drawing the weight of the
   ancestral past into the present moment, thereby tangibly enlivening
   cultural and spiritual connections generationally today. Our exploration
   in this article provides new theoretical perspectives and fresh
   historical insight into the ways in which photography has been
   substantially deployed by an Australian Aboriginal nation as a subtle
   and potent tool to assert self-determination, document survivance, and
   enact visual sovereignty.},

Abstract = {In the mid-nineteenth century, technicians at the Austrian Royal and
   Imperial Court Printing Office devised the first method for mechanically
   reproducing nature prints: that is, prints from intaglio plates made
   from the impression of botanical specimens. Despite the complexity and
   apparent limitations of the process, Alois Auer, director of the
   printing office, claimed that the new process was more important than
   photography. This surprising claim forms the basis of the following
   investigation into mid-nineteenth-century photography, nature printing
   and the world of print-media. The race to devise a mechanical process
   for reproducing images led to a variety of ingenious inventions before
   the half-tone process fully solved the problem of rendering photographs
   in printers' ink near the end of the century. Only in the context of
   other nineteenth-century processes to reproduce images do we begin to
   discern the common properties of photography and nature printing.},

Title = {<i>Pro Pelle Cutem</i>: Photographing Furs for the Hudson's Bay
   Company's 250<SUP>th</SUP> Anniversary Celebrations in Canada},

Abstract = {In 1920, the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) celebrated its 250(th)
   anniversary through national and international events, as well as
   honours and benefits for its employees. The year 1920 was an important
   moment for the HBC, as it underwent institutional change to support the
   expansion of its department store operations through public relations
   and advertising strategies. Central to these strategies was an emphasis
   on the HBC's central role in Canadian nation formation, and in
   particular its fur trade history. This article discusses the use of
   photography in the HBC's 250(th) anniversary celebrations through an
   analysis of photographs of fur. I trace photographic representations of
   fur through three moments: in the process of extraction (as trapped
   animal or dead pelt); in the process of preparation (as Indigenous bush
   labour); and in the process of consumption (as fur goods in a department
   store window). While the fur trade was declining in significance at the
   time of the 250(th) anniversary celebrations, its symbolic status was
   essential to the Company's burgeoning retail operations. In this
   article, I argue that the photograph of fur replaced the fur pelt as the
   central trade item of the HBC, and, further, that photography fused
   together nationalist and capitalist expansion in Canada.},

Title = {Lorene Squire's Psychical Landscapes of Colonial/Modern Gender in the
   Canadian North},

Abstract = {From 1937 to 1939, Lorene Squire was commissioned by The Beaver (the
   company magazine of the Hudson's Bay Company) and Canadian Airways to
   produce photographs of the Canadian North suitable for their
   publications, focused on her specialisation in wildfowl photography, as
   well as landscapes, planes, and people. This article focuses on her 1938
   commissions, and in particular two photographs of Indigenous women and
   two self-portraits. When these photographs are considered alongside
   photographs of white settler women, her correspondence, and her book
   Wildfowling With A Camera (1938), I argue that they offer insights into
   gender as a colonial concept (what Maria Lugones calls the
   colonial/modern gender system'). I contend that the setting of the
   North' as a psychical landscape makes Squire's contestations possible.
   Squire's photographs resist common ways of depicting white and
   Indigenous women in the 1930s, but they do so in a way that is
   paradoxical and leaves intact the colonial/modern gender system. In
   addition to providing biographical information about Squire, this
   article contributes to theoretical and historical scholarship on the
   meaning of photographs of Indigenous people in Canada for projects of
   nation-building and northern economic development, as well as on how the
   North functions as a reference point for Canadian identity.},

   generation of picture postcard views of historical monuments in the
   Korean peninsula. These sites were preserved, reconstructed and promoted
   as tourist destinations by the Japanese colonial administration, the
   transportation industry and local developers in order to promote
   Japanese tourism during the colonial occupation of Korea (1910-45).
   Through an analysis of picture postcards and other tourist materials
   made for Japanese tourists in Korea, this study argues that the
   aesthetic, historical and ethnographic knowledges contained in this body
   of colonial-era visual materials were pivotal in the creation of a
   timeless' image of Korea and its peoples as the most picturesque and
   ancient land in the Japanese empire.},

Abstract = {This article reviews the portrayal of the city in photography as
   deserted space, from Daguerre to the present day. The photographic
   rendering of the urban scene as architectonic and unoccupied originated
   with the early mechanical limitations of the medium. After photography
   became more sophisticated technically, photographers elected to depict
   the urban landscape as a `void' for symbolic, aesthetic and artistic
   purposes. The author places this photographic trope within the context
   of architecture and urban history, literary and artistic movements.},

   traces the historical development of this photographic genre through an
   investigation of statements made by `stillmen' in trade journals such as
   International Photographer throughout the 1930s and 1940s. In addition,
   the article discusses the aesthetics of the film still, which implies a
   specific kind of dealing with light, focus, narrative, time, temporality
   and the instantaneous. Finally, it investigates how these elements were
   taken up by some prominent contemporary art photographers and video

Journal = {HISTORY OF PHOTOGRAPHY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {35},
Number = {3},
Pages = {296-312},
Abstract = {The British Surrealist painter, collagist and photographer Julian
   Trevelyan became involved during 1937 and 1938 with Tom Harrisson's
   anthropological research organisation `Mass-Observation'. The images he
   created during his short periods of observational study in Bolton and
   Blackpool - or `Worktown' and `Worktown on Holiday' are powerful in
   their suggestions of the levels of unease repressed at this tumultuous
   time within the British psyche. The artist achieves these evocations of
   the unconscious mind, which, according to Freudian theory, was the
   director of behaviour, through an amalgamation of documentary and
   Surrealist visualities - in essence, through repeated portrayals of the
   `everyday surreal'. The narrative scrutinises Trevelyan's attention to
   the psychological impact of the nation's material decline upon those
   believed by Mass-Observation to be most directly affected: the
   population of Northern England's industrial towns. This he pursues
   through a systematic visual registration of working-class behavioural
   patterns during `spare time', a time when human beings were reasoned by
   the organisation to be most true to themselves. Ritualistic behaviour
   associated with the consumption of food and drink is considered. So too
   is the pursuit of leisure in Worktown, as well as the religious rituals
   to which its population adhered. The contribution made by Julian
   Trevelyan to British art and letters during the interwar period
   constitutes a fantasmic social psychology of that contemporary crisis.},

Abstract = {Ansel Adams first travelled to Hawai{''}i in 1948 for a project covering
   the US national parks and monuments. He returned in 1957 and 1958 under
   commission from the Bishop National Bank of Hawaii (now First Hawaiian
   Bank) to produce the centennial publication The Islands of Hawaii. The
   photographer's visits coincided with the US territory's postwar campaign
   for statehood, which began in 1947 when the first postwar bill for
   statehood appeared before Congress and ended in 1959 when Hawai{''}i
   became the nation's fiftieth state. This article considers Adams's work
   in the islands within the context of the postwar Hawaiian statehood
   campaign and in relation to the photographer's previous work at the
   Manzanar Relocation Center. Focusing on Adams's photographs of island
   residents within The Islands of Hawaii in relation to discourses of race
   and nationhood in the mid-twentieth century, this article begins to
   develop a line of inquiry into the artist's political engagements
   outside his well-known conservation efforts.},

Pages = {159-170},
Abstract = {Hannah Maynard was a prolific photographic portraitist who opened her
   first commercial studio in Victoria, British Columbia, in 1862. While
   she maintained a conventional commercial practice, her creative
   photographic work began to assimilate and respond to significant
   societal shifts in unconventional ways. In the 1880s Maynard started to
   experiment with a variety of avant-garde' techniques including photo
   collage, photo montage, photo sculpture, and multiple and composite
   images. In her late series of multiple exposure self-portraits, the
   integrity of the self and of the image, an imperative of conventional
   photographic portraiture, comes into question. Through a metaphorical
   relationship with spirit photography, these self-reflexive images toy
   with the distance between realism and surrealism, between coherent self
   and spectral other, and between the living and the dead.},

Abstract = {Richard Daintree is well known as an Australian colonial photographer
   and geologist. I look at six international exhibitions he created from
   1872 to 1879 that promoted the colony of Queensland by systematically
   integrating spectacular grids of painted photographs with displays of
   scientific samples. By analysing installation views, I argue that the
   popular success of these exhibitions came from the use of various new
   photographic technologies within the space of the exhibition, where the
   frontier directly interacted with the metropole. Further, I argue that
   Daintree's personal passion for the science of geology profoundly
   structured the colonialist narrative of his exhibitions, which combined
   the latest apparatuses of scientific knowledge and imperial
   communication, revealing him to be an innovative and internationally
   significant creator of synthesised exhibitionary experiences.},

Abstract = {Among the various new modes for making photographs that were explored by
   Australian photographers in the first decades of the twentieth century,
   three in particular - Pictorialist images, authentic records, and
   personal snapshots - had far-reaching implications for the institutions
   of Australian photography. Pictorialist photographs are now the
   foundation of many Australian art museum collections; photographic
   records produced at the time have become iconic in Australian public
   history, forming the backbone of many social history collections; and
   personal snapshots from the period are increasingly reproduced in social
   histories. Historians of Australian photography have discussed and
   analysed each of these modes(1), but they have tended to treat them
   separately, or even in opposition to each other, and to concentrate on
   the distinct careers of individual photographers. This article looks at
   this crucial period, and these key photographic modes, from the point of
   view of the worldwide networks and systems for the distribution,
   exhibition, collection, and indexing of photographs. We show how these
   modes, far from being distinct, overlapped one another as each grappled
   with the same issues of nation, history, and memory, and as each
   articulated their nationalistic concerns through international networks
   and idioms.},

Abstract = {The role of the photobook has been unjustly neglected in the various
   histories of Australian photography. However, books primarily
   illustrated with photographs and celebrating various aspects of
   Australian life and landscape -'Australiana' photobooks -have been a
   fundamental part of the nation's publishing industry since the 1920s. In
   the postwar decades, and particularly in the 1960s, photobooks were
   especially important to the course of Australian photography. In the
   mid1960s some even aspired to go beyond the well-worn and conventional
   `gift book' formats to become integrated visual and written works
   addressing the crucial national identity issues of the day. In
   particular, two books - Robert Goodman and George Johnston's The
   Australians (1966) and David Beal and Donald Horne's Southern Exposure
   (1967) - can be seen to have been in dialogue with each other. These
   books were the highlights of a mini `photobook boom' that set the stage
   for Australia's much better known `photography boom' of the 1970s.},

Abstract = {If posterity has remembered Paul Sescau at all, it is as the subject of
   one of Toulouse-Lautrec's most enigmatic posters, a work that itself has
   been subjected to much misinterpretation and misdating over the years.
   The mythhas tended to obscure Sescau and his contribution to the
   development of photography as a narrative form of art. Duringhis three
   decades as a professional photographer in Paris, beginning in the 1890s,
   Sescau popularised thephoto-romanand pioneered its portable spin-off,
   the narrative postcard series. However, since his death, Sescau's work
   has generallybeen overlookedashe wasnoticeably reticent, belonging to no
   professional associations,never exhibiting in photographic salons, and
   leaving behind no knownpersonal or studio archives. This article
   retracesSescau's life and careerin photography and his role asan
   unlikely extra in some of Toulouse-Lautrec's paintings. It also
   re-evaluatesLautrec's Sescau poster in thelight of the two men's complex
   creative and social interactions and, in particular, their shared
   enthusiasm for thedance halls of Montmartre.},

Title = {The Key to a Hidden World: Photomicrography and Close-up Nature
   Photography in Interwar Britain},
Journal = {HISTORY OF PHOTOGRAPHY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {36},
Number = {1},
Pages = {87-98},
Abstract = {Upon its publication in Britain, Karl Blossfeldt's photo-album, Art
   Forms in Nature, was something of a publishing phenomenon, striking a
   chord with the general public and going through no fewer than three
   print-runs between 1929 and 1935. Featuring a suite of magnified
   photographs of flower heads, seeds and plant tendrils, the book's
   success powerfully represented the current of interest in close-up
   nature photography contemporaneously experienced in Britain. Indeed,
   between 1929 and 1939 a wide range of publications were released to
   popular acclaim that included lavish albumen or silver-gelatin prints of
   microscopic forms newly disclosed to the human eye through
   photomicrographic technology. At the same time, the embryonic
   documentary cinema movement capitalised upon public enthusiasm for
   scientific discovery by releasing a range of natural history films that
   made use of pioneering micro-cinematographic techniques. While the
   pan-European stimulus of photomicrography on avant-garde activity during
   the 1930s has been well documented by art historians, little work has
   been carried out on the social reception of photomicrography or on the
   specific cultural conditions under which close-up natural imagery was
   consumed in Britain. Framed around the unrivalled critical success of
   Blossfeldt's publication, this article will thus investigate the
   popularity of photomicrography and close-up nature photography in
   Britain between the world wars by analysing their promotion and
   reception.},

Abstract = {This article explores the transnational visual language of picture
   postcards and the international business networks responsible for
   producing and disseminating the image of Dutch colonialism around 1900.
   Following a microhistorical approach, I consider the multilayered
   representation and transnational production of one particular postcard
   sent from colonial Indonesia to the Netherlands in 1900. The postcard
   established, visualised, and catalysed colonialism through its use of a
   European visual language. Colonialist meaning was attached to the image
   in Germany and was reinforced through the process of the postcard's
   delivery from colony to metropolis. This article moves beyond a
   nation-based framework and instead analyses the meanings of colonial
   imagery in transnational contexts.},

Abstract = {In 1976, Anne Wilkes Tucker became the founding curator of the
   Photography Department at the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, going on to
   organise more than forty exhibitions, publish dozens of articles and
   books, and fundamentally shape the museum's collection of more than
   thirty thousand photographs. This article situates Tucker's early career
   in the context of the 1970s `photo boom' in the USA, a period of fervent
   interest and activity around the medium of photography. The article
   particularly examines the reframing of (some) photographs as serious art
   collectibles, and the intersection of the nascent market for
   photographs, the establishment of new museum collections and the
   proliferation of different forms of photographic scholarship during this
   period.},

Abstract = {Like past avant-garde movements, glitch and noise in the twenty-first
   century are used to reveal the materiality of the medium. But instead of
   providing insight or clarity into the politics or social conditions of a
   technology, they demarcate broader conditions of opacity and blockage,
   contributing to what Jodi Dean has called communicative capitalism'. The
   work of German photographer Thomas Ruff alongside the Du..sseldorf
   School, New Photography and JPEG technology are used in this article to
   illustrate this tendency as a move away from meaning and toward visual
   noise and communicative breakdown. I use three core analytic registers:
   the deliberate failure to adhere to visual norms, communicative failure
   and machine failure and breakdown. Ruff's work uses visual noise as art
   to at once reaffirm pervasive conditions of breakdown, failure and
   decline in high-tech global capitalism, while simultaneously providing a
   temporary reprieve from these conditions through an emergent form of
   visual beauty.},

Journal = {HISTORY OF PHOTOGRAPHY},

Volume = {35},
Number = {1},
Pages = {6-14},
Abstract = {This article analyses Patrick Clancy's photoscroll 365/360 (1985) as an
   important postmodern image/text investigation into the problematic of
   the moving still that plays between photography and film and challenges
   the medium specificity of the Modernist paradigm. 365/360 consists of a
   number of interweaving and open-ended micro-narratives conveyed (and
   interrupted) through six rows of images, two registers of text, and the
   spaces opened up between them. The micro-narratives principally involve
   the dispersed journeys of artists Arthur Cravan, Mina Loy, and Marcel
   Duchamp during the First World War. These are oblique avant-garde
   narratives that revolve around questions of travel (what produces images
   in motion) and that engage `the art of getting lost', reflecting back on
   the viewer's own precarious situation at the borders of (non)sense and
   (dis)orientation when viewing/experiencing this complex work. The
   article maps the key figures of the winged hermetic, cataloguer of
   (photographic) grain, and nomadic browser embedded in 365/360.},

Journal = {HISTORY OF PHOTOGRAPHY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {40},
Number = {4},
Pages = {388-412},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Although a milestone in the history of Latin American photography, the
   work of Horacio Coppola is little known outside Argentina. His
   unorthodox angles and tilting frames, his attention to industrial and
   urban themes, and his experimentation with different lenses in the
   period between 1927 and 1931 were in absolute synchrony with the
   precepts of European New Vision and New Objectivity photography, and
   with American straight photography. That Coppola's visual idiom was in
   tune with the latest photographic developments in interwar Europe is
   obvious. What remains unclear is how exactly he achieved that synchrony.
   Several scholars have wrestled with this question, which nevertheless
   remains elusive due to lack of evidence of direct contact with European
   photography prior to his studies at the Berlin Bauhaus in 1932 and his
   repeated attempts to downplay the influence contemporary photographers
   had on his work. The article provides a systematic study of Coppola's
   aesthetic genealogy and his photographic borrowings through a critical
   examination of his early pictures and theoretical writings. It teases
   out possible direct and indirect channels of dialogue with the New
   Vision, New Objectivity, and straight photography in the second half of
   the 1920s, and probes the reasons behind Coppola's reluctance to admit a
   connection with contemporary European photography in particular.},

Abstract = {A vibrant centre of cultural and artistic production, interwar Paris
   attracted many photographers from central Europe. Bringing with them
   inherited traditions and visual lexicons from their countries of origin,
   this heterogeneous group of photographers, which included Ilse Bing,
   Andre Kertesz and Germaine Krull, put their acquired skills and habits
   to use in new contexts, drawing inspiration from each other, from their
   engagement with the vibrant culture of France, and most of all from a
   widespread fascination with Paris as photographic topos. Responding to
   nostalgia for images of a `popular Paris' in the illustrated press,
   these photographers accomplished an alchemical transformation of Paris
   into a city in which past and present were poignantly reconciled. At the
   same time, many of their photographs, shot through with themes of exile
   and homelessness, reveal the fragility of the myth of a `popular Paris',
   particularly after the advent of economic and social crises in the
   1930s.},

Abstract = {This article re-interprets the American photographer Walker Evans's
   Havana portfolio from a perspective that combines psychology and
   geography. By taking this approach, the article intends to reflect
   further on a number of the photographer's developing methods and
   processes, which were implemented whilst documenting his visit to the
   Cuban capital. In this discussion a number of theoretical issues
   relating to the medium of photography emerge in a way that examines the
   relationship between photography and psychogeography. This is
   illustrated via an exploration of the photographer's practice with
   reference to psychogeography itself and is developed with reference to
   the act of urban wandering and the figure of the flaneur. These inform
   the photographer's visual understanding of the physical presence of the
   city, upon which he attempts to imprint himself in a way that is both
   involving and deliberately disassociative.},

Abstract = {This article investigates the political ramifications of the Japanese
   postwar revisiting of the nineteenth-century photographs of Hokkaido, a
   northern island colonised by the Japanese empire in 1869. Compared with
   the programme of American Western Settlement, the Hokkaido Colonisation
   Project actively adopted photography as an efficient means of
   documentation and communication. The historical photographs of Hokkaido
   were reinterpreted by postwar avant-garde artists, who hailed them as
   the origin of documentary photography in Japan. This return to the
   archival records was the ironic result of an artistic response to the
   social milieu of the 1960s, when state ideology and Cold War politics
   were heavily imposed on Japan.},

Volume = {46},

Abstract = {In 1971, men from Musrara, an impoverished Jerusalem neighbourhood,
   formed the Black Panthers in protest against institutionalised
   discrimination against Jews from Muslim countries (Mizrahim). This
   article examines Born in Israel, a photography project by Ya'akov Shofar
   that appeared as a photography book in 1984 and as an exhibition at the
   Israel Museum in Jerusalem in 2017, to unpack the differences between
   these two instances. Shofar's 1984 project portrayed young Mizrahi
   Musrara men while being interviewed by a Jerusalem municipality social
   worker. This collaboration had political potential but only fragments of
   these interviews are reproduced in the book. Although the men
   participated in the Black Panthers' protests, the book underscores their
   ethnicity and avoids mentioning this movement. My study explores the
   visual and discursive elements that depoliticised the book due to the
   Black Panthers' perceived threat to the hegemonic social order and in
   relation to local developments in photography as fine art. I show that,
   unlike the book, the 2017 Israel museum exhibition promotes Born in
   Israel's relation to the Black Panthers, but also had limitations and
   contradictions. Finally, I argue that accounting for the unabridged
   interviews uncovers hegemonic Israel's patronising attitude towards the
   marginalised photographed men, and compensates for lacunas in this
   project's presentations.},

Abstract = {Dada and Surrealist photographer Man Ray is rarely associated with
   street photography, a genre popular with artists and writers of the
   1920s and 1930s. Yet his work demonstrates a closer connection to this
   area than has previously been acknowledged. From the early Dada
   constructions to the later photographic depictions of Paris and New
   York, the city played a crucial role in Man Ray's artistic output. This
   essay explores Man Ray's urban photography not as an uncharacteristic
   shift of concerns, as some critics have argued, but rather as an
   extension of the aesthetic approach taken in his more famous
   studio-based works. It explores the influence of Eugene Atget, whom Man
   Ray claimed to have `discovered', and argues that the latter draws on
   the older photographer's compositional structures, pushing them into
   more abstract, formalist territory.},

Pages = {376-391},
Abstract = {This article examines the photographic subject of the return of Austrian
   prisoners of war in the aftermath of the Second World War. Scholars and
   curators have singled out what are known as the homecomer' photographs
   by the Austrian photographer Ernst Haas, praising their artistic quality
   and assigning these works an iconic status. This approach has obscured
   the broader historical background of this subject as well as the
   editorial practices, collaborative efforts, and propagandistic
   intentions of these works in the field of photojournalism. In contrast,
   this article focuses on the immediate historical and political context
   of returning prisoner-of-war photographs in the Austrian illustrated
   press, arguing that they were part of a broad visual discourse
   deliberately adopted by the postwar media for the purposes of Cold War
   propaganda.},

Abstract = {Resistance or struggle photography is a term describing the photographic
   documentation of conflict between oppressed and oppressor from the
   perspective of the subjugated. An example of this genre is explored in
   the context of apartheid South Africa during the 1980s through the work
   of a collective called Afrapix. This group's images of the repression of
   Black and Coloured populations by the apartheid regime, although largely
   curbed in South Africa, found an extensive international reception.
   These photographs contributed to the worldwide condemnation and
   sanctions that ultimately led to the collapse of the apartheid
   government. Whether photographs should be used as weapons in the
   political struggle, a position fostered by the African National Congress
   (ANC) and accepted by Afrapix, is explored through the divergent views
   of the photographer David Goldblatt. The decline of Afrapix is examined
   in relation to shifting market and aesthetic considerations following
   the end of apartheid.},

Title = {Windows Onto Things:The Phenomenology of Glass in Josef Sudek's
   Photography},
Journal = {HISTORY OF PHOTOGRAPHY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {42},
Number = {2},
Pages = {185-201},
Abstract = {Over fourteen years, Czech photographer Josef Sudek photographed three
   windows in his small ramshackle Prague studio at least a hundred times.
   This project, The Window of My Studio, meditates on the frost, dew, and
   dirt that accumulate on the window's glass, and the still lifes that
   emerge in the margins. Sudek's focus on the often opaque pane becomes an
   analogy for the limits of human vision. I argue that the abstract glazed
   surface and the repetitive nature of Sudek's windows exemplifies Maurice
   Merleau-Ponty's description of a multifaceted and infinitely variable
   object. However, I also challenge Merleau-Ponty's dismissive attitude
   towards the medium of photography by suggesting that Sudek's process and
   photographs reveal a phenomenological gaze. Sudek's window series led to
   a long rumination on the phenomenology of glass through photographs. His
   following two projects (Still Lifes and Labyrinths) revolve around
   still-life photographs of glass panes, cups, vases, and lenses. Glass,
   an object that reveals, reflects, and transforms its surroundings,
   becomes a promising metaphor for embodied human perception. This article
   takes Sudek's persistent and even obsessive use of glass in his still
   lifes seriously. His engagement with his subjects, similar to a
   painterly relationship with the world, allows for a slower philosophical
   exploration of the world through photography. When considered as
   cohesive projects, Sudek's photographs reveal a complex internal
   phenomenology - one that relates to our own being in the world.},

Abstract = {Edouard Manet's life and work have been studied using photographic
   sources that provide essential yet still underutilised information about
   his oeuvre and artistic process. Beginning in the 1860s, Manet employed
   the firm of Anatole Godet to photograph his paintings, probably as
   records of stock, and this article considers how Manet may have used
   these photographs as the basis for tracings and watercolours that served
   as intermediaries in the production of etchings after several of his
   canvases. Godet also photographed the posthumous retrospective of
   Manet's work in 1884, providing the only known images of that landmark
   exhibition. After Manet's death, Leon Leenhoff, the son of Manet's wife
   Suzanne Leenhoff, hired Fernand Lochard to photograph works remaining in
   the artist's studio, and in several other locations, to illustrate a
   corresponding inventory. The photographs were annotated by Leon with
   information about each work including its exhibition history and bound
   into albums. While select scholars have engaged with these important
   materials, Manet's use of photography and the role photography played in
   the posthumous dissemination of his works remain insufficiently
   understood. Taking Olympia as a case study, this article aims to
   demonstrate how these archival sources contribute to Manet studies.},

Abstract = {Far from being `over', photomontage has proliferated in our digital age,
   most commonly as meme. Although seemingly based on wit's lowest common
   denominator, memes illustrate the mass reach and cohesive function of
   the medium but also tell us something about the mood of the moment. It
   is the untapped potential of the medium that interests me here. Drawing
   on the anticipatory history of Marxist practitioners in the 1920s and
   1930s, including Walter Benjamin, Ernst Bloch, and John Heartfield, this
   article traces the coordinates of a potential radical practice that
   sparks discomfiture and cognitive reorientation. Rather than reproducing
   knowledge, photomontage can produce new forms of understanding; it can
   do so in complex and continually generative ways that remain
   underexplored in the digital age, in which an epistemology of suture
   predominates.},

Title = {Repetition and Remembrance: The Rephotographic Survey Project},
Journal = {HISTORY OF PHOTOGRAPHY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {38},
Number = {2},
Pages = {137-160},
Abstract = {This essay considers the role of repetition and remembrance in the
   Rephotographic Survey Project (1977-79) and the related Third Views
   project (1997-2000), directed by the photographer Mark Klett. Premised
   on reconstructing topographically exact replicas of select photographs
   taken by various late-nineteenth-century survey photographers, both
   projects raise important questions about our relationship to this
   historic archive of photographs of Western America. By juxtaposing the
   original expedition photographs with `second views' taken a century
   later, and later with `third views' based on the `second views', these
   projects help to visualise changes in the original sites over the course
   of a hundred years, as well as a shorter span of twenty years. By thus
   pairing an original photograph with its second and even third views, and
   proposing the addition of subsequent views by future photographers,
   these rephotography projects, along with the most recent one called
   Reconstructing the View (2007-11), propose continually re-signifying
   viewers' relation to the Western American landscape and the past it
   represents. In doing so, they generate a construct of landscape that is
   textual and discursive or an effect of the relationship amongst shifting
   images and discourses. Such a construct, effectively manifest as well in
   the verbal/visual landscape representations of Robert Smithson, counters
   the traditional construct of landscape as a framed pictorial entity that
   can be viewed in a single glance. It also suggests that repetition
   functions in the Rephotographic Survey Project, Third Views project, and
   Reconstructing the View project, as a means of generating remembrance
   through the procedure that Sigmund Freud called `deferred action'.},

Abstract = {This essay addresses ways in which sentiment was mobilised in social
   reform photography, specifically in the lantern slide presentations of
   Jacob Riis and in Harvard University's Social Museum-a collection of
   empirical data in the form of photographs and related graphic and
   text-based materials for the comparative study of social problems and
   solutions. Through his displays of previously unseen living and working
   conditions of the urban poor, Riis manipulated his audiences' emotions,
   provoking fear of and pity for the impoverished and immigrant masses. In
   contrast, the Social Museum was established to `promote investigations
   of modern social conditions and to direct the amelioration of industrial
   and social life'. While its founder Francis Greenwood Peabody also used
   sentiment as amoral catalyst, the vast majority of photographs in the
   Social Museum served a didactic purpose, portraying reform initiatives
   and institutions that he viewed as the only solutions to social
   problems.},

Abstract = {Canadian photographer Richard Harrington has been recognised since the
   1950s for his photographs of the Arctic, and specifically for portraits
   of the Padleimiut taken at a hunting camp in 1950 during a winter of
   acute shortages. Three were selected for Edward Steichen's The Family of
   Man (1955). Of that group, two focused on motherhood through depictions
   of childbirth and maternal love; the latter is sometimes referred to as
   `Canada's Madonna and Child', making a timeless secular icon from the
   representation of a crisis. Harrington was a documentary photographer
   who made his living as a freelance photojournalist specialising in human
   interest stories and travel features for magazines and newspapers. On
   assignment in British Columbia for the Hudson's Bay Company magazine The
   Beaver, he photographed a First Nations mother and child, an image
   entitled `Madonna of the Peace'. This photograph later graced the cover
   of a Roman Catholic missionary magazine, Pole et Tropiques. This article
   draws parallels between Harrington's photographs of Indigenous mothers
   and children and Dorothea Lange's Migrant Mother, using Harrington's
   diaries and community-based research to reconstruct the lives of his
   subjects, and considering the sacrifice of knowledge to iconicity.},

Abstract = {This article examines Afro-Brazilian photographer Januario Garcia's
   images of the favela Morro do Salgueiro in Rio de Janeiro, shot from
   late 1983 to early 1984. I argue that through his depictions of
   traditional family units, architectural details and children in front of
   Rio's cityscapes, Garcia made activist photography that showcased the
   favela as a humane and family-oriented place, in opposition to the
   government and white elite's historical denigration of such
   neighbourhoods - hilltop shantytowns with predominantly Black residents,
   often located next to wealthy neighbourhoods. Garcia positioned the
   favela's Afro-Brazilian residents as active contributors to the city's
   modern built environment, challenging previous associations of the Black
   figure with folkloric and rural spaces. In addition, his images openly
   display the favela's poverty - an indelible mark of Brazil's persistent
   racism - as a way to combat discrimination and assert Black
   consciousness in a country that sought to erase the presence of African
   heritage especially in centralised southeastern cities.},

   ignored, in part because of a restricted view among historians regarding
   the nature of photography, and in part because of ideological opposition
   to the style engendered by the perception that it was associated with
   dictatorship of General Franco. These political and aesthetic prejudices
   have until now prevented a proper understanding of this exceptional body
   of work in the history of Spanish photography. Pictorialism in fact
   represented the avant-garde in Spain, and the fact that it was so widely
   accepted for so long should be recognized as a sign of its validity and

Abstract = {In its first instance as art practice among the historical avant-garde,
   photomontage was considered indispensable for its claim to intervene in
   perceptual processes, stimulating a critical mode of apprehension that
   would redirect the viewer away from conventions of aesthetic experience
   and towards a lived reception of art with pronounced relevance to the
   sociopolitical landscape. The effect was understood as structural, that
   is, activated not so much by direct political content, but by the stark
   and shocking effects of juxtaposition. By this measure, one challenge to
   contemporary photomontage is clear: in a postindustrial and postdigital
   visual landscape dominated by the structural fragmentation of the
   attention economy, the `simultaneity of the radically disparate' (as
   Peter Burger put it) might no longer present as heterodoxy but rather
   threaten to sink into invisibility. Yet with the migration off-screen of
   the effects of electronic media, a new urgency around moving
   photomontage structures into physical, public space is rising in
   contemporary practices. Shannon Ebner's multi-part project A Hudson Yard
   (2014-15) is emblematic of the new ways in which artists are
   manipulating photomontage as a form of fully sensory experience that
   gives the medium room to play critically in both virtual and material
   space. By constructing subtle interruptions of naturalised commercial
   space, A Hudson Yard activates a detournement of instrumentalised
   language, using structures of juxtaposition to divert the discursive
   surfaces of public space away from consumption and towards what could be
   called a public poesis.},

Abstract = {Portraiture is one of the most common practices of photography around
   the world. Different cultures have developed distinctive types of
   portraits, from the post-mortem photographs of the Victorian era to the
   funerary portraiture of East Asia. Korea's unique set of photographic
   portrait types revolves around the stages of life: a portrait on the
   hundredth day after birth and the first birthday; family portraits on
   the sixtieth, seventieth and eightieth birthdays; and a portrait for use
   at the subject's funeral. These constitute photographs as rites of
   passage, commemorating the importance of certain stages in life, and
   such commemorative portraiture has come to comprise an integral part of
   modern traditions in Korea. The development of photographic portraiture
   as a modern ritual is closely related to intellectual movements led by
   Korean elites under colonial rule (1910-45); it was nevertheless under
   the military regime (1961-92) that family and baby photographic
   portraiture in South Korea truly began to reflect familial desires
   entangled with those of the state. During the country's compressed
   modernisation', a term used to describe the rapid, lopsided
   industrialisation characterising the military regime, the public began
   to appreciate specialised photographic practices that highlighted
   modern' family structure and values. This article argues that family and
   baby studio portraits, as rite of passage' practices, not only reflect
   the changing demographics of the population - the shift from extended
   families in rural areas to nuclear families in urban centres - but also
   promote a family model suited to the modernisation scheme of the
   military government.},

Abstract = {At the turn of the twentieth century, landscape photography began to
   emerge as a new way to represent nature in Korea. Landscape photographs
   of the Korean peninsula were printed in modern media, such as the daily
   newspaper Maeilsinbo, the public cultural magazine Cheongchun, and
   picture postcards. This article explores the photographic representation
   of nature in Korea in the 1910s. Landscape images of the period were
   rooted in the visual regime of the camera obscura, and they often
   borrowed techniques and themes from Korean traditional landscape
   painting, or sansuhwa. The photographic medium was important in shaping
   new perceptions, aesthetic experiences, and discourses on nature. This
   article examines several categories of landscape photography, including
   images of scenic and historical places, idyllic and bucolic scenes, and
   urban parks. These categories were common in Korean western-style
   landscape painting and art photography of the 1920s, and continue to be
   seen to this day in Korean visual culture.},

Abstract = {As Nadar shifted his attention from caricature to photography in the
   1850s, he produced several fascinating hybrid images. Among these are
   experiments in photomontage and uncommon portraits that combine graphic,
   photographic, and autographic elements. The author shows how Nadar
   cultivated a number of recognisable signatures, which he reiterated and
   adapted for different image-types, products, and advertisements. Nadar's
   investment in self-portraiture, his penchant for publicity, and his
   ability to work across platforms and to balance artistic ambition and
   commercial enterprise are explored in depth.},

   Britain between 1860 and 1910 includes post-mortem portraits. These
   could have been acquired through private commission by relatives of the
   deceased or purchased as part of the retail trade in commercial
   portraits of celebrities. The very small number of articles devoted to
   the subject in the photographic press confirms that photographers
   consciously attempted to portray the dead as if sleeping. Surviving
   photographs reveal how this intention influenced all aspects of the
   portrait, including the treatment of the face, the pose and lighting of
   the body, and the choice of background and accessories. The motives
   behind the acquisition of posthumous portraits remain more obscure: some
   can be ascertained from entries in diaries and correspondence; others
   can be inferred through reference to contemporary attitudes towards
   death and the rituals observed by the bereaved. By suppressing evidence
   of the unpleasant aspects of death and by suggesting a more familiar
   state of being, post-mortem portraits were intended to ease the pain of
   loss and bring solace and comfort to the bereaved.},

Abstract = {Since the late 1970s Cindy Sherman has been one of the most prominent
   artists in the USA. She is a cult figure because of her chameleon-like
   masquerade in a female imagery reminiscent of American and European
   cinema and western art. Her dramatic metamorphosis began with Untitled
   Film Stills (1977-1980), in which she acted out a variety of female
   roles from Hollywood and European movies. In the early 1980s she
   gradually transformed her image into horrific monsters and decaying
   matter. In the late 1980s Sherman assumed different male and female
   personas based on old master paintings. Since then, the subject matter
   of her pictures has increasingly been taken up by hybrid dolls with
   surreal or grotesque connotations. This paper attempts to venture back
   into the terrain of Untitled Film Stills that inaugurated Sherman's
   artistic career. This series of photographs has become one of the most
   prominent landmarks of feminist/postmodern art. I will propose a new
   interpretation against the grain of the established feminist readings of
   these photographs.},

Volume = {40},

Abstract = {Alois Riegl's Late Roman Art Industry has been one of the most
   influential books in the historiography of art and archaeology since its
   publication in Vienna in 1901. Riegl's treatise fundamentally altered
   the way Late Antique art was perceived and evaluated by historicising
   vision and theorising the relativity of aesthetic ideals. This article
   claims that Riegl's argument was originally made in images as well as in
   text, but that his visual rhetoric was lost when Otto Pacht edited Late
   Roman Art Industry for republication in 1927 and changed its
   illustrations. The article demonstrates that Pacht's pictorial
   amendments manifest the concerns of a new generation of formalist art
   historians, raising broader questions regarding the role of photography
   in art history's disciplinary codification. Restoring Riegl's visual
   argument, the article contends that Riegl used photography to visualise
   his innovative methodology and model a historically specific gaze.},

Abstract = {Charles Marville's photographs of Paris preserve the look of streets
   slated for demolition under Georges-Eugene Haussmann. This article
   examines his photographs of the Carrieres d'Amerique, or America
   Quarries - gypsum quarries in the outlying Parisian neighbourhood of
   Belleville. At a time when the rezoning of districts that were formerly
   extra muros was still controversial, Belleville was seen as a
   crime-ridden area. Marville's photographs become documents that refute
   contemporary narratives of criminality. Borrowing Walter Benjamin's view
   that the city `opens up' to the flaneur `as a landscape', the article
   analyses Marville's landscapes of the Carrieres d'Amerique as images
   that juxtapose the city, the work site, and the no-man's land or
   terrains vagues at Paris's outer limits.},

Abstract = {A few years after opening their celebrated photography studio in their
   new home in Philadelphia, German immigrants William and Frederick
   Langenheim produced eight almost identical daguerreotype panoramas of
   Niagara Falls. Keeping one set for themselves, they sent the others to
   multiple heads of state. The brothers' identities as American
   photographers and experiences as German immigrants, this article
   demonstrates, shaped their specific photographic vision of the
   impressive cataracts as well as its circulation abroad. By calling
   attention to the German dimensions of this project, this article
   underscores their panorama as an important articulation of
   German-American identity formation. The article thus highlights the
   intercultural nature of the Langenheim brothers' photographic practice,
   and the fact that the medium itself was rooted in international networks
   and trade in the mid-nineteenth century. Through a close examination of
   their advertising campaigns, their relationship with optician Peter
   Wilhelm Friedrich von Voigtlander and their extraordinary 1845 panorama,
   this article allows us to better understand how ideas of culture were
   negotiated through the making and distribution of early photography.},

   John W. Bennett during the Allied Occupation of Japan. Bennett was Chief
   of the Public Opinion and Social Research Division of the Civil
   Information and Education Section of the Supreme Commander of the Allied
   Powers. In his photographs, Japanese women can be seen fraternising with
   GIs, working as prostitutes, and enjoying everyday life with their
   children. We see the occasional man farming the land, building a house,
   collecting human waste, or begging in Ueno Park in Tokyo but the new
   Japan and its future seems to be in the hands of women. For an
   Occupation that was initially intent on destroying Japan's war-making
   capabilities, the welfare of veterans was not a priority. Depicting
   women and children was a palatable way of representing Japan as a friend
   and ally.},

Abstract = {Reproductions of artworks were a crucial element of official narratives
   aimed at shaping Polish identity after World War II. In this article, we
   explore the strategies employed in constructing visual messages in the
   first volume of the book series Ziemie Staropolski (Old Poland's
   Territories) titled Dolny Slask (Lower Silesia), published in 1948 and
   devoted to the Western territories ceded to Poland after the war. In our
   case studies, we discuss such aspects as, on the one hand, framing,
   lighting, viewpoint and selection; on the other, geographical, political
   and social contexts. We propose two notions to explain the political use
   of reproductions. The first is geohistorical medium, which we employ in
   reference to how reproductions actualise the meanings of artworks in
   relation to geography and history. The second is affective reproduction,
   which we use to address deliberately shocking arrangements of
   reproductions with photographs that include ruins, artworks or people.
   We emphasise that both strategies aim at a specific group of viewers
   whose experiences oscillate between memories of war and hopes for the
   future. The reproductions we discuss participated in the construction of
   the postwar geopolitical order in Central Europe.},

Abstract = {This article examines ways in which the question of image profusion
   occupied photography circles in interwar Germany, analysing in
   particular decisions to reject, glorify, or tame photography's evident
   abundance. While art photography around 1900 sought to legitimate its
   standing through rarity, during the late 1920s the New Objectivity and
   New Vision movements instead trumpeted quantity as the basis of their
   aesthetic claims. Their success quickly prompted a wave of criticism
   summed up by the term `photo-inflation': a deregulated `wastefulness' in
   imagery that threatened in the longer run man's very critical and
   perceptual faculties. In the wake of this articulation of threat, work
   in series became one possible way to domesticate image profusion, to
   accept its inevitability while giving it a framework. Pushing further,
   the creation of archives, especially in collective undertakings, seemed
   to regulate the problem. Defended first by the left as a means to
   overcome capitalist structures of competition, this discourse of
   collective effort was soon co-opted by the National Socialists. In the
   process, a rhetoric of common effort became reconciled with an emphasis
   on elites and hierarchical formations - for example, in juried
   competitions or expert advice columns - in which `great photographers'
   were made into `guides' for the limitless mass of amateurs.},

Abstract = {In 1927, an inquiry into what has come to be known as the Forrest River
   massacre sent shockwaves across Australia and overseas, playing an
   important part in the shift toward better treatment of Aboriginal
   people. The evidence tendered to the inquiry was narrowly forensic,
   focused upon dates, places and human remains, alongside three
   photographs of the outback crime scenes: how were these grainy,
   scratched, inscrutable images seen at the time? How should we look at
   them now? The horrified public preferred to look at more eloquent,
   familiar images of Indigenous suffering. In this paper I review these
   parallel, sometimes intersecting, ways of seeing Aboriginal people, and
   consider the role photography has played in arguing for Indigenous},

Abstract = {Photographs were a powerful means of communicating ideas about
   Indigenous peoples, despite their sometimes diffuse and ambivalent
   meanings. Only recently, however, has visual evidence begun to play a
   part in Australian debates about colonial violence and oppression.
   During the decades around the turn of the nineteenth century, which in
   Britain marked a transition from an evangelical tradition of
   anti-slavery to a new discourse about human rights, campaigns against
   the `new slaveries' of European imperialism in Africa, and especially
   the Congo reform movement, made highly effective use of photographs of
   colonial atrocities. Yet the campaign against the ill-treatment of
   Aboriginal people of Western Australia, waged at precisely this time,
   was limited in its capacity to arouse popular interest either
   domestically or in Britain. This paper explores the complex process of
   seeing and overlooking, remembering and forgetting, that characterised
   views of the northern frontier, through an investigation of photographs
   of Aboriginal imprisonment during the first years of the twentieth
   century. It also addresses their deployment within technologies of
   Indigenous memory and other more recent uses, where they have assumed a
   prominent symbolic place in books, films, art and political protests,
   invoking a longer tradition of appeal and rescue, with varying effects.},

Abstract = {As the first art book to be illustrated with photographs, William
   Stirling's Annals of the Artists of Spain (1848) pointed the way for the
   use of photographs and photographically illustrated books as essential
   tools for the study of art history. During preparation of his landmark
   art historical work, Stirling had demonstrated his interest in the
   reproduction of art by commissioning copies in oils and watercolours of
   Spanish Golden Age paintings. Many of these were then photographed for
   the Talbotype illustrations to the Annals. The Talbotypes had many
   shortcomings as reproductions of art, not least the fact that the
   finished volume included no direct reproductions of original paintings,
   though small-scale, original works of art including sculpture reliefs,
   drawings and prints were photographed directly. Stirling's decision to
   issue the Talbotypes as a separate, limited edition volume also reflects
   the many technical difficulties experienced during the project. The
   Talbotypes were taken by William Henry Fox Talbot's assistant, Nicolaas
   Henneman, whose bill for the supply of these to Stirling is published as
   an appendix to this article.},

Abstract = {This article examines a series of portraits of the poet Charles
   Baudelaire made by the photographer Nadar and taken during the 1850s and
   early 1860s. In particular, it focuses on the so-called `Godoy' portrait
   now in the Musee d'Orsay. It is well known that Baudelaire expressed
   antipathy to photographic representation in his review of the Salon of
   1859. However, Baudelaire's involvement in the portrait process and the
   content of a letter addressed to his mother offers evidence that, it is
   suggested, puts this received understanding into question. Baudelaire's
   interest in photography is read in the context of his poetry. Enlisting
   the writings of Walter Benjamin, it is argued that the temporality of
   photography is not only inflected in the poems themselves but is also
   understood as an allegory of the nature of modernity.},

Abstract = {This paper re-evaluates the association between Eugene Atget and
   Surrealism by means of a reading of several essays by Walter Benjamin
   written during the 1920s and 1930s. The well known but brief moment of
   surrealist reception of Atget was superseded when later and more
   influential writers viewed him instead as an important forerunner of
   documentary photography. To this end, surrealist meanings and values
   became occluded by various writers, while the poetic or `aesthetic'
   features of the photographs were marginalised. I want to suggest that
   the oneiric qualities of Atget's work should not be ignored or opposed
   to documentary or materialist readings - rather, it is the peculiar
   suspension of documentary and aesthetic modes that characterises his
   work and locates it in a particular historical moment. In forging this
   argument I enlist Benjamin, who made Atget a key figure in his
   discussion of the surrealist aesthetic and for whom the political force
   of Surrealism lies in its simultaneous intensification and overcoming of
   conceptual, spatial and temporal boundaries. It is argued that
   Benjamin's surrealist reading of Atget illuminates the way in which
   Atget's photographs thematise the transformation of aesthetic and social
   space, destabilising the fixed categories of photographic realism and
   art.},

Abstract = {The advent of the photographic existence of the work of art and the ways
   in which this facilitated new modes of reception have been the subject
   of a number of recent art historical studies and exhibitions. In the
   late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, a diverse community of
   writers and intellectuals attempted to grasp the significance of art
   seen photographically. However, since the reality effects of photography
   were so powerful, recognition of the impact of photographic mediation
   remains implicit in many accounts across a range of contemporary
   sources. This essay examines the impact of the photographic reproduction
   of the work of art through a case study of two writers, now well known
   for their reflections on the implications of photographs for memory,
   subjectivity, aesthetic value, historicism and allegory. It explores
   Marcel Proust's description of Giotto's Karitas, in particular those
   references made to its appearance as a photograph in his
   autobiographical novel. As a member of the first generation to
   experience habitually the work of art in a photo mechanically reproduced
   state, Proust reveals the shocks involved in these encounters, shocks
   that institute a new relationship between the viewer and the work of
   art. Proust's novel is thus read as a counterpart to Walter Benjamin's
   famous essay of 1936, `The Work of Art in the Age of its Technological
   Reproducibility', in which Benjamin discusses the implications of
   photographic reproduction for the changing concept of the work of art.
   Benjamin has been much criticised for factual inaccuracies in his essay,
   but it is argued here that Proust's interrogation of the experience of
   the work of art through photography demonstrates some of the qualitative
   shifts in perception that are at the core of Benjamin's thesis.},

Abstract = {This essay critically analyses Michael Fried's book Why Photography
   Matters as Art as Never Before. It examines the relevance of Fried's
   categories of absorption and theatricality to contemporary photography
   and his assumption that photography is an inherently modernist art. In
   his book Fried explains the shift to large-scale colour photographs in
   the 1980s as signalling a return to problems of beholding, which
   dominated painting since the 1750s and 1760s. In contrast, this essay
   argues that this shift reveals the importance of the legacy of
   conceptualism and minimalism to recent photography and, in particular,
   the role of the conceptual `document' within contemporary artistic
   practices.},

Title = {Displaced `Origins': William Henry Fox Talbot's <i>The Pencil of
   Nature</i>},
Journal = {HISTORY OF PHOTOGRAPHY},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {32},
Number = {4},
Pages = {314-325},
Month = {WIN},
Abstract = {This essay analyses William Henry Fox Talbot's book of photographs The
   Pencil of Nature (1844-1846), in which he discusses the role of the
   photograph as a document. By emphasizing the historical specificity of
   the book, this essay argues that it presents an undecided and reserved
   view with regard to the future of the photograph. The Pencil of Nature
   is neither embedded in the discourse of the mechanical and mass-produced
   copy, nor is it embedded in the idea of the `authentic' copy or index,
   as has been suggested in recent theories of photography. instead, it
   reflects a specific form of Romantic historicism which emerged in the
   early nineteenth century as part of a shift in the organization of
   knowledge. Talbot's statements on the evidentiary status of the
   photograph are thus related to literary genres of writing, and, in
   particular, to Thomas Babington Macaulay's work, to the historical
   novels of Sir Walter Scott, and to Talbot's own philological and
   classical studies. In this context, the intelligibility of documents is
   a function of time, yet time is simultaneously a source of constant
   change and the intellectual `horizon' within which things acquire their
   meaning. This, the writer contends, forms the discursive framework
   within which Talbot's views on the document are formed: on the one hand,
   the desire for `truth', on the other hand, the recognition that time
   dismantles any claim for the universality of knowledge.},

Abstract = {Using Thomas Demand's work as an example, this essay considers the
   symbolic function of photographs as illustrations of historic sites or
   events. Demand takes pictures of large-scale sculptural paper models,
   which are reconstructions based on existing images, many of them images
   of historic significance. The hybrid nature of these photographs is
   embedded in the process of their making and reveals itself only after
   close examination. Traditional notions of indexicality are suspended
   since the final image is not directly connected to the time or place
   where the `original' was taken. For the viewer, this process of removal
   is countered by the immediacy of the photographic image and raises
   questions about our relation to photographs as illustrations of history.
   These complex layers come into focus if one reads Demand's artistic
   project through the lens of Braco Dimitrijevic's propositional
   photographs of the 1970s. Unlike many early conceptualists, Dimitrijevic
   did not invoke the `documentary' photograph in order to subvert veracity
   but to demonstrate the suggestive power of the image, even when it
   operates in the realm of hypothesis. His images of nondescript sites
   carry the title, `This could be a place of historic interest', and the
   combination of image and text pushes the definition of history and the
   photograph beyond the limits of a complete and closed past into a future
   tense. The Suspension of photography's indexical power is also a central
   aspect in Demand's work, although he achieves this through an
   intermediary step rather than a linguistic directive. In Demand's images
   the historic (con)text is always implied but never accessible, and this
   separation temporarily liberates the image from any prescriptive reading
   and shows the image as artifact. Demand's photographs go far beyond a
   play with authenticity. One might say this is simply his artistic
   method. Instead, I read his work as an exploration of the symbolic
   nature of photographs (and especially the historically significant
   photograph) through a process of abstraction and defamiliarization.},

Abstract = {In the 1970s, Gilbert Gimon discovered the daguerreotype work of Jules
   Itier and subsequently published two articles: one in French in 1980 and
   one in English in 1981. The historical importance of this discovery is
   now firmly established and the two articles have become key sources of
   reference. However, a close study of these publications reveals mistakes
   and assumptions that require resolution. Part one of this article
   considers two phases of gathering and dispersal of this body of work,
   first in the mid-nineteenth century and subsequently in the twentieth
   century. Individuals, situations and institutions are identified in
   order to assist with the necessary corrections and reinterpretations. In
   part two, Itier's journal and Gimon's articles are cross-referenced in
   relation to new source materials in order to undertake an in-depth
   investigation of a number of plates presented in chronological order.
   This has resulted in the correction of a number of erroneous dates and
   statements made by Gimon. In the process, an unexpected new name in the
   early history of photography was revealed in relation to the earliest
   clearly dated photograph of India. This article concludes with a new
   reading of Itier's work and its significance for the history of
   photography in Asia.},

Abstract = {This article discusses the reception of Surrealism in England between
   1936 and 1939, when the movement became embroiled in questions of
   cultural identity and critics such as Herbert Read attempted to
   assimilate it into the broad tradition of Romanticism. Focusing upon
   photography, the article considers how Humphrey Jennings, Paul Nash,
   Eileen Agar, Len Lye, Roland Penrose, Lee Miller and Bill Brandt
   assimilated Surrealism to their own artistic concerns. in addition, it
   examines the national inflection assumed by the work of those artists,
   as, for instance, in the distinctively English form of `Seaside
   Surrealism'.},

Abstract = {Thilly Weissenborn (1883-1964) was one of Indonesia's first woman
   photographers of significance. She was born in Java but schooled, like
   most Netherlands colonials, in The Hague. At the age of eighteen, Thilly
   returned to Java where she trained in the famous Atelier Kurkdjian
   before opening her own studio in the province of Preanger. For more than
   two decades, she supplied the colonial government's tourist bureau with
   photographs featuring Java's exotic-looking scenery and Balinese temples
   and dancers. She also supplied Dutch dignitaries, colonial officials and
   wealthy Dutch families with souvenir albums featuring scenic photographs
   and Bali's governors and royalty. I argue that although her growing
   obsession with light was a feature shared by many contemporary American
   photographers, her photographs differed from theirs by dint of their
   connection to Netherlands colonialism. I further argue that this is most
   evident in their focus on the beauty of the landscape and the seeming
   tranquillity of life under colonial rule, but also their strong
   allusions to the Mooi Indie style of paintings popular among Dutch
   settlers. In the twenty-year period leading up to Japan's invasion of
   Indonesia, Weissenborn's images were widely sought after and reproduced
   by the Dutch East Indies Tourist Bureau; however, their strong
   connection to Netherlands colonialism means that they are today not just
   regarded ambivalently by photographic historians, but are frequently
   overlooked.},

Title = {Modernist Photography and Women's Social Networks: The Case of Olive
   Cotton and Margaret Michaelis},
Journal = {HISTORY OF PHOTOGRAPHY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {41},
Number = {3},
Pages = {241-261},
Abstract = {This article's title refers to the larger project of illuminating the
   social networks informing Australian artistic communities from the late
   colonial period to the middle of the twentieth century. Focusing
   primarily on developments in photography, the article itself asks what
   were the links between creative practices and the social relationships
   that characterised the modernist period in particular? It attempts to
   answer this question by examining the relationship between two
   retrospectively celebrated women photographers working in the war years
   in Australia - Olive Cotton and Margaret Michaelis. For a fair portion
   of their lives Cotton and Michaelis lived in the same city, worked
   contemporaneously in the relatively small field of studio photography,
   and shared similar artistic and commercial ambitions, yet they had
   virtually no professional or personal contact with each other. There is
   some evidence to suggest that social networks played a role in training
   early Australian women photographers, particularly those working in the
   professional studio system between the 1890s and the 1920s. Social
   networks would take on an explicitly political role in the
   consciousness-raising feminist context of women's photography in
   Australia from the 1970s to the 1990s. Given that Cotton and Michaelis
   were professional photographers during the interval between these
   periods, one is bound to ask whether their lack of contact had a
   personal basis or there was a wider more socially determined reason. In
   other words, was there something about the social conditions effecting
   Australia's artistic associations at this time that explains the lack of
   artistic connections between women, and if so was this lack the same
   across all the arts or particularly pronounced in photography?},

Abstract = {The St. Louis World's Fair of 1904 was an occasion for celebrating the
   USA's purchase of the State of Louisiana and the American government's
   recent annexation of the Philippine Islands. So that Americans could
   familiarise themselves with the people from their latest acquisition,
   hundreds of live Filipinos were placed on display at the fair. Also
   featured were Asian people from a variety of Pacific Rim nations. A
   small group of women photographers were charged with the responsibility
   of photographing these visitors. This essay focuses on the work of two
   of these women - Emme and Mayme Gerhard from St. Louis. The essay
   examines some of the more stereotypical images of Japanese, Chinese,
   Alaskan and Filipino subjects they produced at the fair alongside images
   they created that awarded the same ethnic groups humanity and identity,
   asking how should we understand this seeming tension in their work? Was
   it the result of an implicitly imperialist mode of photography practised
   by white middle-class women as Laura Wexler has claimed, or were there
   other important factors at play?},

Abstract = {In the early years of the twentieth century the Hawaiian-based American
   photographer Caroline Gurrey produced a much praised set of the
   photographs of Hawai'i's `mixed race' children. Critics have noted that
   stylistically Gurrey's photographs belong to the pictorialist school and
   possibly even to the high art style of the Photo-Seccessionists, however
   research into her background and life, and the contexts in which these
   photographs were produced and consumed, suggests that if we want a
   fuller understanding of both Gurrey's intentions and these photographs'
   historical importance, we should also take note of the part they played
   in the burgeoning eugenics movement and indigenous Hawaiians' reactions
   to American imperialism.},

Abstract = {`It is important to note that a photomontage need not necessarily be a
   montage of photos', the Constructivist writer Sergei Tretiakov declared
   in 1936. `No', he clarified; `It can be photo and text, photo and
   colour, photo and drawing'. In 2019, `photo and smartphone' might also
   appear in Tretiakov's list. The volatile image, filtered through
   applications and shared across shifting platforms, is far from a new
   phenomenon. Networks of photographic dissemination and manipulation,
   traceable to the medium's origins, have long precluded the possibility
   of a still photograph. As digital processes abstract cutting and pasting
   from scissors and glue, avant-garde photomontage offers a useful model
   with which to regard today's unprecedented fluidity of images.},

Abstract = {In 1968 two generations of Japanese photographers came together to
   research and curate the most comprehensive exhibition of the history of
   Japanese photography to date. Examining five hundred thousand
   photographs from public and private collections across the archipelago,
   they ultimately presented 1,640 images in a widely attended Tokyo
   exhibition. Moving beyond photographic nationalism, A Century of
   Japanese Photography was one of the only instances of public critique of
   the role of photographers who collaborated with the Japanese state
   during the Fifteen Year War (1931-45) and the exhibition's popularity
   launched the movement to build the largest photography museum in Japan.
   Through analysis of the exhibition and establishment of the Tokyo
   Metropolitan Museum of Photography, I illuminate how the process of
   writing the first major history of Japanese photography and building an
   institution to house its archive was a practice informed by the changing
   meanings of the role of photographers and museums within Japanese
   society.},

Abstract = {Through an exploration of the history and legacy of the first
   photography studio in Mbouda, Western Cameroon, this paper focuses on
   links between professionalism in the local photography trade and the
   importance of the studio establishment. Despite increasing access to
   cheap cameras and colour processing, the photography studio remains an
   aspiration for local photographers, evidencing contradictions in the
   economic drivers maintaining the operation of photographic studios. The
   paper explores notions of recognition and remembrance inherently linked
   to photography practices for photographers and their subjects. It also
   looks at how a professional career can be validated through the visible
   presence of the photographic studio, constructions of local memory and
   the alteration of images for new audiences in the international art
   market and scholarly archive.},

Title = {The revival of `Photographer's Travels' during the era of globalization},
Journal = {HISTORY OF PHOTOGRAPHY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {35},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {166-179},
Abstract = {During the 1980s, when it became increasingly easy to traverse great
   distances and ever more people went abroad, travel became associated
   with capitalist, globalized economies and lost the anti-establishment
   aspect that it had possessed in the 1960s. Photographers whose work
   focuses upon travel have to invent new forms of travelling, forms
   capable of counterbalancing global homogenization and reviving the
   radical nature of travel. Martin Parr and Tom Wood have focused upon
   unexceptional journeys, shopping trips to Boulogne or Calais and bus
   journeys around Liverpool; Thierry Girard, Marc Deneyer and others have
   slowed their modes of travel, paying particular attention to details and
   inconsequential events in order to heighten their significance (walking,
   for instance, results in the establishment of new relationships with the
   places); other photographers have adopted self-imposed constraints that
   have necessarily affected their travel experiences. In one way or
   another, such departures reinstate the unconventional and potentially
   subversive nature of travel. Au moment ou les communications a distance
   et les deplacements se multiplient, le voyage en lui-meme n'a plus la
   meme valeur contestataire que dans les annees 1960-1970. Les
   photographes qui associent intimement l'exercice de la prise de vue a
   une pratique itinerante ont tendance a inventer de nouvelles formes de
   parcours du territoire, qui s'averent susceptibles de faire contrepoint
   aux idees dominantes. Ainsi Martin Parr ou Tom Wood choisissent de
   suivre des itineraires de proximite; Thierry Girard, Marc Deneyer et
   d'autres optent pour une certaine lenteur; nombreux sont aussi ceux qui
   decident de regir leurs deplacements par des protocoles contraignants a
   meme de servir une auscultation renouvelee du territoire. D'une maniere
   ou d'une autre, l'ecart avec la norme restitue au Voyage une dimension
   subversive.},

Title = {The Black (and White) Humour of Artur Harfaux},
Journal = {HISTORY OF PHOTOGRAPHY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {38},
Number = {2},
Pages = {187-196},
Abstract = {The work of Artur Harfaux, a member of Le Grand Jeu between 1927 and
   1932, deserves to be reassessed. Harfaux produced a number of more or
   less staged photographic portraits of his friends Roger-Gilbert Lecomte,
   Rene Daumal, Josef Sima, Maurice Henry and other protagonists of the
   movement. He created fancy and inventive photomontages, double-exposed
   portraits and almost abstract pictures of veils blowing in the wind.
   Beyond their diversity, Harfaux's works are characterised by a subtle
   humour. Sometimes the humour that prevails is ironic or self-derisive,
   while on other occasions the works are informed by black humour or the
   burlesque. A study of the work of Harfaux leads to a reconsideration of
   the importance of humour and laughter - formidable forces of
   destabilisation and of detachment - in the revolt of the members of Le
   Grand Jeu as well as in the endeavours of the Surrealists.},

Abstract = {This article examines the life and work of the nineteenth-century
   French-American artist Victor Prevost. While Prevost's name is familiar
   to photography historians, the diversity of his artistic accomplishments
   has not been fully appreciated. An artist celebrated for work in several
   mediums, Prevost was already making large-format calotypes in 1851 while
   living in New York City. He was also responsible for innovations in
   telescopic photography, joining with astronomers at the West Point
   Military Academy in 1854 to capture a solar eclipse on paper. This paper
   seeks to broaden knowledge of Prevost's life and work as a commercial
   artist in New York during the nineteenth century.},

Abstract = {This article provides a brief introduction to an intriguing series of
   Brassai photographs of sculpture stored in the church of Saint-Sulpice
   in Paris during World War 11. It employs a contemporary set of
   photographs on the same subject by an unidentified photographer of the
   French Press \& Information Service to furnish an illuminating
   comparison with the Brassai images. Placing these photographs in their
   historical context, the article explores the events surrounding the
   relocation of sculpture to the crypt of the church and highlights the
   extraordinary efforts made by the City of Paris to protect works of art
   during the war. It also discusses how Brassai and his contemporaries
   used the imagery of the wartime art evacuations as an effective and
   haunting metaphor for the human toll of war.},

Abstract = {Across three decades at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA),
   curator Sandra S. Phillips (American, born 1945) built a distinctive
   photography collection and exhibition programme driven by her
   institution's geographical setting. In response to Phillips's oral
   history excerpt for the project Framing the Field, this article
   identifies intuition as an emphasis of Phillips's interview and her
   curatorial practice. Challenging the perception of intuition as
   irreconcilable with traditional scholarly expertise, this article
   examines it as a form of knowledge and core component of ideation.
   Combined with her art historical acumen, Phillips's stance of
   receptivity towards SFMOMA's location in the Bay Area, California, the
   western USA and the greater Pacific Rim propelled her shaping of the
   institution's photography programme. Ultimately, her example indicates
   how intuition and expertise are mutually constitutive and intertwined.},

Abstract = {The remote West Australian town of Broome has a unique photography
   heritage that sheds new light on the complexities of photography and
   intercultural relations. During the early twentieth century thriving
   Japanese communities were established in this region around the
   lucrative pearling industry. These Japanese communities also helped to
   develop a fascinating photography culture in Broome. Photography was not
   simply a business opportunity for the Japanese or a means of documenting
   people and events; it was a medium through which hierarchised social
   relations were produced, redefined, and challenged. This article
   examines photographs by these Japanese residents as an important site of
   cross-cultural communication and interpretation. These photographs of
   Anglo-Australian, Japanese, and Aboriginal residents of Broome enrich
   the study of cross-cultural photographic encounters, and emphasise the
   dynamic and dispersed qualities of Australian photographic practice and
   history. Here national histories of photography are usefully
   conceptualised as the products of imbricated social, economic, and
   cultural relations that operate across regional, national, and
   international realms.},

Title = {Through Japanese Eyes: Ichiro Kagiyama and Australian-Japanese Relations

Journal = {HISTORY OF PHOTOGRAPHY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {38},

Abstract = {The activities of a little known Japanese photographer working in
   Sydney, Australia during the early to mid twentieth century sheds new
   light on the photographic connections between Australia and Japan. The
   life and work of Ichiro Kagiyama are important catalysts for rethinking
   dualistic relationships between the `West' and the `East', and for
   developing an approach that allows for more nuance and complexity.
   Working directly with Australian photographers and tastemakers at a time
   when the so-called White Australia policy defined Australia as a
   racially exclusive country, Kagiyama challenges expectations about the
   historical relationships between Australia and Japan. Kagiyama's work
   also illustrates the interrelationships between diverse forms of
   photography practice, from art and commercial photography to espionage,
   as well as close connections between the worlds of art, design,
   international trade and photography in 1920s and 1930s Sydney. As
   Kagiyama's photographs resist essentialist readings yet were framed when
   published by stereotypes of Japanese culture as traditional, feminine
   and decorative, they help to tease out a certain tension within
   Australian-Japanese relations in the lead up to the Second World War.},

Abstract = {Photographs of and by indigenous people in colonial countries have
   received considerable scholarly attention since the 1980s, but the role
   of colonisation in shaping the meaning of photography has been widely
   neglected. This article addresses this lacuna by focusing on metaphors
   of light, darkness and race, through which photography was made
   meaningful in colonial Australia. Representations of Aboriginality in
   photographs and in cartoons addressing photography are analysed to
   reveal how colonialist assumptions about race, light and darkness inform
   conceptions of Australian photography as process, brand and movement.},

Abstract = {Kirlian photography records the corona discharge that commonly surrounds
   any conductive object placed in a dielectric enclosure at atmospheric
   pressure within a high voltage/high frequency electric field. That
   generated by a Tesla coil is particularly effective. Kirlian photography
   was popular in the decade between 1970 and 1980, and leaves and the tips
   of fingers were common subjects. The discharge usually took the form of
   bluish spicules and glows proceeding from sharp points and edges of the
   specimen, and around ridges and elevations in its interior. The overall
   appearance of the discharge is dependent on many factors, and may
   continually change on a small scale. Reproducibility is therefore poor.
   There is no satisfactory proof of claims that the coronae around finger
   tips reflect the physical or mental health of the subject or can
   disclose psychic influences.},

Title = {Side by Side: The Halftone's Visual Culture of Pragmatism},
Journal = {HISTORY OF PHOTOGRAPHY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {41},
Number = {3},
Pages = {286-310},
Abstract = {Charles S. Peirce's late-nineteenth-century semiotic theory has long
   been considered one of the key frameworks for analysing the photograph
   as a visual sign. This article, however, proposes a closer look at
   Peirce's contemporaneous philosophy of pragmatism as a fundamental
   component of the visual, cultural, and intellectual context within which
   the photographic halftone first emerged. When, exactly, did it begin to
   matter if a photographic image made up of a certain arrangement of
   graphic marks was read differently from a photographic image made up of
   a different arrangement of graphic marks? Such pragmatist questions were
   crucial to the early reception of halftone reproductions, which were
   often integrated into illustrated magazines as simply one element within
   an already diverse array of graphic codes. Turning to Jacob Riis's How
   the Other Half Lives (1890) as a case study, this article argues that
   reading the halftone as a chiefly photographic sign was not in fact an
   inevitable outcome of its introduction into the illustrated press in the
   1880s and 1890s, but required instead a constant negotiation of both
   visual and conceptual imprecision - an imprecision eventually smoothed
   over in favour of an association of halftone technology with
   photographic ontology by the early twentieth century.},

Abstract = {Umbo, one of the most stylistically influential photographers in Europe
   during the 1920s, followed a singular path that went beyond New
   Objectivity and Constructivism. In his photography he merged the
   stylistic elements of the `New Vision' with the expressive aesthetic of
   Johannes Itten, his teacher at the Weimar Bauhaus. Unlike Albert
   Renger-Patzsch and Laszlo Moholy-Nagy, Umbo adhered to a romantic,
   poetic understanding of art. He took from Itten the idea that artistic
   perception of the world exists not in seeing alone but in three
   `movements': seeing, feeling and recognising. Umbo therefore
   acknowledged in his work above all emotional need, a subject banned by
   `New Photography' on the grounds of inconsistency with scientific
   accuracy and objectivity. In contrast to much `New Vision' photography,
   optical means of expression do not become independent in Umbo's images,
   but serve in the formation of ideas, feelings or daydreams.},

   professional emergence of women photographers in Bamako, the capital of
   Mali. The founding of the school Promo-femme: Center of Audiovisual
   Education for Young Women by Aminata Dembele Bagayoko has had an
   influential effect on the field's gender demographic, enabling women to
   not only engage in, but become successful at, this formerly all-male
   profession. I analyse the production of three women working in 2006 in
   different photographic genres: Penda Diakite, a studio portraitist;
   Alimata dite Diop Traore, a photo-journalist; and Fatoumata Diabate, an
   artist. The professional lives and works of these three women comprise
   an arena of active contestation over female identity in Mali.},

Abstract = {In 1941, the Rath Packing Company of Waterloo, Iowa published a book
   titled Waterloo Packer: The Story of the Rath Packing Company to
   celebrate its fiftieth anniversary in the meatpacking industry. Modelled
   on Life magazine, Waterloo Packer co-opted the photoessay format to
   commercial ends. Examining archival documentation and looking at other
   American industrial publications, this article illuminates Waterloo
   Packer's conception by executives of the Rath Company and consultants
   from advertising agency Young and Rubicam; and it contextualises
   Waterloo Packer as the most innovative of a series of industrial
   biographies' produced in the USA at midcentury. Through close reading of
   Waterloo Packer as phototext, this article demonstrates how the Rath
   Packing Company deployed photographic imagery to present a controlled
   and sanitised vision of industrial-scale slaughter.},

   photojournalism, Morris contributes a thoughtful analysis of The Family
   of Man, its origins, message and impact. Born in 1916, John G. Morris
   was an eye-witness to key political events informing the philosophy
   behind the exhibition. As Picture Editor for the London Bureau of LIFE
   magazine during World War II, and later, as executive editor of Magnum
   Photos, he worked closely with the premiere photojournalists of the
   period, many of whom contributed work to the exhibition. `People Are
   People the World Over', Mori-is's innovative series of photo essays for
   Ladies' Home journal, influenced Edward Steichen and, ultimately, the
   shape of The Family of Man. Morris provides a unique perspective on the
   historical and political context of the exhibition.},

Abstract = {This article examines the use of shadow, blur, graininess, and
   reflection in the work of the postwar photographers Robert Frank,
   William Klein, and Ralph Eugene Meatyard as a response to the rhetoric
   of Cold War containment. In contrast to the more comforting images in
   Edward Steichen's popular exhibit The Family of Man, which sought to
   downplay Cold War anxieties, the photographs of Frank, Klein, and
   Meatyard challenged viewer expectation by presenting human figures in
   varying states of disintegration and disappearance. The term
   `subjective' has long been used to describe a return to personal and
   private concerns during the postwar years, but discussion has focused
   mainly on the subjectivity of the artist rather than the viewer. By
   challenging the sanctity of the human figure, Frank, Klein, and Meatyard
   force viewers to confront such difficult images and, in the process,
   re-examine the fears and anxieties that lay dormant during the tense
   years of the early Cold War.},

Abstract = {A new chapter in the history of photography in Iran begins with the rise
   of the Pahlavi Dynasty. Not only does the state emerge as a client, but
   the relative stability of the two decades from 1920 to 1940 paves the
   way for the average citizen to enter the photography studios. The forced
   unveiling of women during this period plays a significant role in the
   promotion of family photographic portraiture. This period is also
   characterised by the gradual institutionalisation of the practice of
   photography through various official venues, public use and the
   establishment of the institutions necessary to promote the technique and
   education and to solidify its economic base. These years can be
   characterised as a transition or grey period.},

Abstract = {Royal patronage enabled photography to enter Iran, but it spread through
   the country without much difficulty, cost being the main impediment.
   Women faced a particular obstacle, however, for religious prescriptions
   prevented their sitting for photographers other than close kin. A
   newspaper advertisement of 1877 indicates that women were not allowed in
   photography studios. King Naser-ed-Din Shah Qajar (r. 184898) ignored
   such restrictions and photographed his wives. Not only did he himself
   photograph, but he also trained his servants and harem eunuchs to do so.
   The elite followed him in embracing the new invention, but they were
   reluctant to allow their wives to be photographed in public studios.
   Some set up household darkrooms, and thus women were photographed in a
   number of these families. This article examines how women were portrayed
   in photographs during the Qajar era by European male and female
   photographers and by Iranian female and male photographers; it also
   examines dossiers relating to the photography of women from the
   mid-1850s through the 1930s.},

Abstract = {The increasing interest in media history within the academic world has
   not yet resulted in an intensive examination of the relationship between
   photography and communications media. This article seeks to begin to
   address this lacuna by examining photography's insertion into the
   so-called revolution of communication in middle-nineteenth-century
   America. The first section of the present study links photography to the
   introduction of telegraphy, the development of the railway and the
   expansion of the postal system. The second section examines aspects of
   the reception of photography in nineteenth-century America and argues
   this is related to improvements in communication and transportation
   technologies. The conclusion calls for a broader consideration of the
   links between the history of photography and the history of media.},

Abstract = {This essay explores the meaning and significance of Alvin Langdon
   Coburn's photographs of Edinburgh. These images were taken in 1905 as
   illustrations for Robert Louis Stevenson's romantic panorama of
   Scotland's capital, Edinburgh: Picturesque Notes, first published in
   1878. Stevenson and Coburn never met, but the photographer was
   enthralled by the writer's recollections of his `precipitous city'.
   Coburn, like Stevenson, favoured `Old Town' Edinburgh. His fascination
   with the medieval town, which stands in opposition to the rational plan
   of the `New Town', reflected his emerging distaste for the modern world.
   I argue further that, despite his interest in photographing the modern
   city and despite the development of a modernist style in his
   Vortographs, Coburn was temperamentally inclined to nostalgic and
   romantic tropes. This disposition was perfectly expressed in his
   Pictorialism. In this respect, Coburn's drift away from photography,
   after 1920, was not straightforwardly a reaction to the emergence of
   `straight' and `formalist' photography. Nor was it wholly the natural
   ascendancy of his mystical vocation. Rather, he was reacting against the
   materialism and rationalism of the modern world. In Edinburgh Coburn
   discovered a world congenial to his romantic spirituality.},

Abstract = {Whether through the bond between the text and the image (illustration,
   photography) or, as is the case in the photomontages, between textual
   and visual fragments, the new hybrid forms that emerge promote an
   inter-medial and cross-boundary aesthetic. It is not only in her
   self-portraits but also in her literary works, her Surrealist objects
   and her enigmatic photomontages in Aveux non avenus, that Claude Cahun,
   often in close collaboration with Marcel Moore, her life partner, or
   with other artists and writers like Pierre-Albert Birot and Lise
   Deharme, explores the correlations between words and images, the body
   and its social representations, the subject and identity. As such, she
   focuses upon themes which are highly en vogue in the interwar
   avant-garde milieux, and which, under the sign of postmodernism, have
   dominated discourses on sex and gender, the mise en scene of the self
   and gender performance over the last twenty years. Subscribing to the
   Surrealist notion of ars combinatoria by illustrating it in their
   creations from the 1920s and 1930s, Cahun, Moore and Deharme's aesthetic
   approach gives birth to object books transformed, under the influence of
   the principles of collage and montage, to plural book-objects, that is,
   to Surrealist books.},

Abstract = {This essay discusses photographs produced during Japan's little-known
   colonial expedition to the Ogasawara (Bonin) Islands in 1875-76.
   Investigating the photography of Ogasawara, which pictured the
   cosmopolitan native population, the Japanese colonial presence, and the
   natural landscape of the islands, exposes the processes that have
   configured modern `Japaneseness'. Matsuzaki Shinji's images circulated
   in both government and commercial realms. With these diverse routes came
   multiple meanings that attached to the evolving place the islands
   occupied within the national consciousness. The islands could ostensibly
   be shown to have historical roots in the Japanese past, despite being
   populated by undeniably foreign inhabitants. Matsuzaki's photographs
   read as an attempt to display the `natural' landscapes as remote and
   untouched, whilst simultaneously trying to prove a historical and
   legitimate Japanese connection. This reveals the contradictory Japanese
   view of the native population as `Western' but `primitive'. The tension
   between Japan as inferior in its power relationship to the West, yet
   superior in its ability to rule over the mostly Western subjects of
   Ogasawara, permeates the construction of the islanders as Japanese
   internal `others'.},

Abstract = {This paper concerns two collections of photographs made in Paris during
   the 1830s and 1860s. The first archive was assembled by the Paris police
   in the course of enforcing laws against the production and distribution
   of obscenities. These photographs were pasted into an official arrest
   register and served as legal evidence. The second collection, a set of
   stereographs made by Auguste Belloc for clandestine commercial
   distribution, was seized in a police raid but never inserted into the
   register. The author analyzes the evolving style of the photographs in
   these collections, correlating the changes with patterns of prosecution
   documented in public records. The study reveals the intricate
   relationship between photography and modern notions of gender, identity
   and the imaging of sex.},

Abstract = {This article maps out the genealogy of the Korean term sajin, which
   began to be used as a translation for photography in
   late-nineteenth-century Korea. A genealogical study of the term sajin
   and its extension to the naming of photography provides a foundation to
   comprehend the processes in which the reception of photography as a new
   cultural product was framed by Korean indigenous practices of
   representation and their related cultural discourses. One of the main
   objectives of this essay is to highlight the fact that the concepts of
   photography and photographic technology were not simply imported into
   Korea from the West, but were actively recoded in ways that responded to
   established cultural and political discourses of Korea, and
   intercultural dialogues between East Asian countries. Emphasising the
   discursive specificity of photography in Korea, I move beyond the
   familiar discourse of centre and periphery that has shaped the narrative
   of western globalisation. This article will be of interest to
   contemporary historians and theorists of photography who are seeking
   alternatives to Euro-American notions of photography and its history.},

Abstract = {Despite recent feminist scholarship on women's roles in the American
   Civil War (1861-65), their photographic participation remains poorly
   understood. As a result, women's wartime entrepreneurialism has not been
   recognised, and neither has their agency in shaping the image economy
   and visual history of a nation-defining conflict. This article presents
   the first dedicated research on Elizabeth Beachbard, an elusive figure
   who ran an ambrotype portrait business in Louisiana during the conflict.
   This article charts her trajectory from downtown New Orleans to a
   military camp in rural Louisiana where she photographed soldiers during
   the summer of 1861 until her death only months later. I consider the
   gendered constraints on women's photography of the epoch and the
   methodological challenges for researching female photographers,
   examining the historical context for women's entrepreneurialism and the
   circumstances that led to Beachbard's business model. As well as
   analysing her practice as a female operator in a military camp, this
   article presents new evidence for an ambrotype hitherto unattributed to
   Beachbard, which constitutes only the third extant example of her work.
   I contend that Beachbard should be seen as a pioneering figure in the
   history of women's photography, and might be considered America's first
   identifiable female photographer of war.},

Abstract = {The photographs of Jose Ortiz Echague are often read in terms of
   artistic and documentary values, with the two poles in tension within
   his work. Echague's project Spain. Types and Costumes was an attempt to
   document systematically traditional Spanish costumes. At the same time,
   Echague never abandoned pictorialist techniques, which are often
   considered contrary to documentary intentions. This article discusses
   the types and costumes series from a historic perspective based in the
   social uses of photography. This perspective shows how the same images
   were considered in different contexts as artistic or documentary images,
   or as propaganda icons in both sides during the Spanish Civil War.},

Abstract = {This essay analyses Kurt Tucholsky and John Heartfield's 1929
   Deutschland, Deutschland uber Alles. In this `picture-book' right-wing
   nationalism, the Military, the democratic system, and capitalism were
   trenchantly criticized. This essay argues, however, that Deutschland,
   Deutschland uber Alles is as much about the role of photography in
   society as it is about Weimar's political situation. The late 1920s are
   generally seen as a period of medium optimism in which the new
   photograph), was in the forefront. Yet a close analysis of the use of
   photography in Deutschland, Deutschland uber Alles nuances the so-called
   optimism of Weimar visual culture and its sudden disruption by the
   advent of fascism in the 1930s. While from the early 1910s onwards,
   Tucholsky had promoted the polemical power of photography, his position
   shifted by the end of the 1920s. An ambivalence marked Deutschland,
   Deutschland uber Alles: on the one hand the photographic medium was used
   as a critical tool; on the other, the book reflects an underlying
   critique of and frustration with photojournalism and its association
   with urban modernity.},

Journal = {HISTORY OF PHOTOGRAPHY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {46},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {9-19},
Month = {JAN 2},
Abstract = {At first glance, it appears as though Sir Joshua Reynolds's The Ladies
   Waldegrave (1780) is in two places at once: Strawberry Hill House and
   the National Gallery, Edinburgh. Despite their visual
   indistinguishability, however, the former is a copy of the latter
   created by Factum Foundation in 2018. In this article, I discuss the
   ontological relation between paintings and their visually
   indistinguishable facsimiles, along with certain consequences that
   relation has for display practices. Traditionally, paintings are
   understood to be ontologically singular; no copy, however faithful, can
   ever stand in as the work itself. Using The Ladies Waldegrave, I defend
   ontological singularity while maintaining that these visually
   indistinguishable facsimiles can be used to promote engagement with, and
   a better understanding of, originals. Drawing on the philosophical idea
   that objects have temporal parts, I suggest that what I call suitable
   facsimiles - copies that are visually indistinguishable from originals -
   are representations of particular temporal parts of those originals. My
   proposal allows paintings to maintain their singularity while
   acknowledging that some copies share a special relationship with the
   originals such that the former can stand in for the latter. I conclude
   by considering issues concerning the display of both originals and
   suitable facsimiles.},

Abstract = {Several large-scale photographic exhibitions featuring substantial
   participation from the USSR were organised in Czechoslovakia in the
   1930s. Despite the number of local and foreign actors they involved, and
   the critical response they triggered, they have raised limited scholarly
   interest so far. To shed light on the conditions under which these
   events were planned and realised, it is necessary to turn to exhibition
   catalogues, archives of the organisers and press reviews. Based on this
   data set, this article questions the part these displays played in
   propagating Soviet photographic discourses and aesthetic models in
   Czechoslovakia. New evidence from the archives of the Soviet All-Union
   Society for Cultural Ties Abroad (Vsesojuznoe obscestvo kul'turnoj
   svjazi s zagranicej {[}VOKS]) suggests that the Marxist critic Lubomir
   Linhart was the most committed mediator of Soviet photography and
   promoter of its documentary and utilitarian approach. By orchestrating
   the Soviet participation in the two exhibitions of social photography in
   1933 and 1934, the International Exhibition of Photography in 1936 and
   in several unrealised projects, Linhart and other supporters of the USSR
   had succeeded, by the late 1930s, in asserting the photographer's social
   function in Czechoslovakia, in close relation to the Soviet discourse on
   functional and politically committed photography.},

Abstract = {The history of issues of privacy in relation to photography is generally
   dated to the introduction of handheld cameras and halftone printing at
   the end of the nineteenth century. Citing a remarkable series of
   notations in the records of famed Montreal photographer William Notman,
   this article argues that privacy concerns were at issue in the everyday
   operations of the photography studios that preceded amateur photography.
   These notations represent the rudimentary attempts that some of Notman's
   clients made to restrict the circulation, sale and availability of their
   studio portraits starting in the 1870s. This article speculates that the
   emergent anxieties regarding privacy exemplified by such notations were
   informed by the setup and marketing practices of early photography
   studios. Ultimately, this analysis seeks to show that current debates
   about privacy, photography and visibility can be traced back to the
   commercial systems that developed in tandem with early photography
   technologies.},

   children, which were exhibited and published in 1992 under the title
   Immediate Family. Most of the Immediate Family photographs were made at
   the Manns' rustic summer house in a wild, isolated area, not far from
   their home in Lexington, Virginia. The children are often naked or
   nearly naked, and they are variously dirty, injured, confrontational and
   flirtatious. Strong and divergent responses to the Immediate Family
   photographs affirm art historian Anne Higonnet's conclusion that `No
   subject is as publicly dangerous now as the subject of the child's
   body'. This article expands on the spatial dimension to Higonnet's
   insight, and argues that the anxieties about Immediate Family stem from
   photography's refusal, or perhaps confusion about, the division between
   public and private. The circulation of the Immediate Family project
   suggests how notions of public and private are negotiated through
   photography.},

Abstract = {This article explores the photographic physiognomy of Victorian asylum
   superintendent Hugh Welch Diamond. Through close readings of Diamond's
   photographs as well as commentary published by Diamond and Dr John
   Conolly, the author argues that Diamond expanded the meaning of the word
   physiognomy to include metonymic traits such as clothing and hairstyle.
   Diamond used physiognomy for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes,
   and he staged his photographs to maximize their efficacy for both,
   creating a mediated mirror through which his patients viewed themselves.
   Through photographic physiognomy, Diamond tried to change the nature of
   asylum practice, using images of his patients to nurture them to health
   without physical restraints.},

   Victoria, 1886-1901},
Journal = {HISTORY OF PHOTOGRAPHY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {34},
Number = {3},
Pages = {214-233},
Abstract = {This paper re-investigates notions of performed Aboriginality in
   relation to photographs made at Lake Tyers Mission Station, Victoria,
   Australia, and argues that Nicholas Caire's photographs reveal complex
   Aboriginal subjectivities. The photographs, made originally in 1886 and
   distributed to tourists, were later reproduced and circulated in book
   format in 1897. The first presentation of the photographs, whilst
   focusing on historical Aboriginality, contains traces of cross-cultural
   hybridity. However, the later presentation of the work reinforces
   historical and traditional material culture over cross-cultural
   dialogue. This paper argues that the desire to find historical notions
   of Aboriginality on mission stations in Victoria was not just due to the
   establishment of hierarchical racial theories in the latter part of the
   nineteenth century (generating the idea that Aborigines could not change
   and adapt to notions of `civilisation') and doubts about the success of
   mission stations, but also because there was an interest in Aborigines
   who had experienced little assimilation from more remote parts of the
   continent of Australia. This curiosity in pre-contact Aboriginality
   fuelled tourism in Victoria to accessible mission stations such as Lake
   Tyers.},

   In it he covered the group's finances, social events and, most
   importantly, its exhibitions. The Photo-Secession is both an attractive
   example of Arts-and-Crafts design and printing and an important
   supplemental source of information on the group.},

Abstract = {Mary A. Bartlett was an early woman photographer, active in Chicago
   camera clubs, and interested in the medium's creative use. This article
   outlines her life and examines the three children's books she

   similar publications of the time, Bartlett's books featured sensitive
   images of children, accompanied by fanciful verse, printed in
   high-quality photogravure. They are Outstanding examples of the genre.},

Abstract = {The artistic imagination of Sugimoto Hiroshi revolves around images of
   the oceanic intended, in their presentation of flat, open, and tranquil
   calm, to counter the forces of modernity and restore a sense of the
   religious in the profane. Sugimoto's oceanic vision, however, also draws
   upon elements of a politically regressive ideology that marked Japanese
   cultural productions in the 1930s which bound the hope of restoration to
   an aesthetics of death and repose. In this article, I illustrate how
   Sugimoto's oceanic vision disturbs this ideology even as it invokes the
   visual and rhetorical structures that marked its forms.},

Abstract = {Oliver Wendell Holmes and David Brewster both described stereoscopy in
   terms of its sculptural quality as a way of emphasising the haptic
   quality of viewing stereoscopic photographs. The phenomenal realism of
   the device augmented the indexical realism of photography. This article
   details the way that the stereoscope intervened in longstanding
   philosophical and scientific debates concerning the relationship between
   vision, touch and depth perception. It also unpicks the popular
   reception of the stereoscope in so far as explanations of its working
   became the subject of conflicting claims by opposing groups of
   scientists drawing on nativist and empiricist accounts of depth
   perception. Debates over the meaning of the stereoscope in the 1840s and
   1850s caution against locating it simplistically as a new, disruptive
   way of seeing; rather, Brewster's influence on popular explanations,
   achieved through his relentless work for the periodical press, suggests
   its pleasure drew heavily on traditional paradigms from optics and
   natural theology.},

Abstract = {In the mid 1880s a little-known photographer named Robert Harris
   produced a series of albumen prints showing the stages of body searching
   that black labourers in De Beers diamond mines were obliged to undergo
   by state ordinance enacted in 1883. The original photographs surfaced
   briefly in the saleroom in 2007 but have since disappeared. Two sets of
   copies survive. Bearing in mind the history of documentary photography
   in South Africa, this article examines the historical and textual
   significance of this series of photographs in the context of the history
   of mining and discusses the imperatives and ethics of locating,

Abstract = {Over the last decade, 35mm slide libraries that were used to support art
   history teaching in higher education in Europe and North America have
   been widely dismantled and dispersed. This article examines the cultural
   values that have been illuminated by debates about their decline and
   disposal, and the contexts and practices for their afterlife. Drawing on
   auto-ethnographic research, interviews with former slide librarians and
   surviving slide library material, the article pays special attention to
   one case study, formerly held at the University of Brighton, UK, to
   trace the slide library's establishment and demise, examine the cultural
   labour of its production and maintenance, and evaluate its
   particularities and idiosyncrasies. Through this, the article outlines
   the values and meanings that were established and contested during the
   slide library's working life and its 2011 dismantling, and considers how
   these have been repositioned in the intervening years. The slide
   library's devaluation contrasts sharply with slides' recent revaluation
   in scholarly interests in photographic materialities and media
   archaeologies, in the retro marketplace and in contemporary art
   practice. Together, these reflections and frameworks provide fresh
   perspectives on dismantled slide libraries and their remains.},

Abstract = {This article explores the early introduction of photographic images to
   the daily newspaper in Korea in the second decade of the twentieth
   century. The technology of mass printing photographic images was
   pioneered by the Government General's Korean-language newspaper, Maeil
   sinbo, in the years immediately after Japan's colonial occupation began.
   The encounter between the two technologies of photography and printing
   thus developed within the broader context of colonial governmentality
   and the simultaneous emergence of modern structures of the archive and
   the individual. Exploration of the first published snapshot series
   offers a case study of the entanglement of modern technologies in the
   social relations of early photographic images. Reading the snapshot
   series today reveals the contours of a politics and aesthetics of
   colonial visuality, which was to long outlive the only apparently
   trivial series.},

Abstract = {This article examines the representation of tea drinking in photographs
   and the commemoration of this pastime in European and Javanese family
   photograph albums, in the Netherlands Indies (colonial Indonesia) during
   the early twentieth century. As ego documents (autobiographical
   sources), family photographs of tea-time reveal how the expression of
   social categories like race, class and gender were choreographed in the
   home by colonial family members for their own viewing. As sources for
   social history, such photographs reflect not just on markers of social
   differentiation, but also on familial cohesion and, importantly, on an
   emerging class solidarity between Javanese and Europeans that
   transcended racial distinctions. Worldliness, domesticity and a peculiar
   mode of civility that would in the European context have been considered
   middle class, but in the Indies were considered elite, were the
   normative cultural standards by which the photogenicity of the colonial
   family was measured in photographs of tea drinking. Tea cups and cameras
   were thus wielded by amateur family photographers to reproduce both the
   hierarchy and unity that simultaneously divided and connected sectors of
   elite colonial society in the early twentieth century.},

Abstract = {In 1898 America made a dramatic switch from isolationism to an
   expansionist international agenda. After a short war with Spain, the USA
   acquired Guam and the Philippines, Congress agreed on the annexation of
   Hawai{''}i and Wake Island, and, shortly after, tripartite negotiations
   led to the acquisition of American Samoa. The USA had become a colonial
   power and acquired a Pacific ``empire'. In 1899 this new status met with
   the publication of Our Islands and their People as Seen with Camera and
   Pencil, a two-volume text that included twelve hundred photographs. The
   pictorialising or visualising of empire in the text was a publishing
   coup. Although historians have been reluctant to acknowledge the USA as
   an imperial power, the analysis here links the visual record of new
   territories in illustrated publications to expanded public awareness and
   a political debate that potentially took Americans to a new level of
   understanding of the Pacific Islands. The analysis of American ``empire'
   suggests that territorial expansion was a long-standing characteristic
   of the nineteenth century that was visualised in photographs for
   national debate.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the relationship between photography and the public
   sphere in pre-Revolutionary Russia. In particular, it focuses on visual
   representations of volunteer and professional firefighters to
   demonstrate the critical role photography played in disseminating a
   conservative and authoritarian message to volunteer firefighters
   throughout the empire. It relates to a broader literature on civil
   society, although it offers a conservative interpretation insofar as it
   indicates how volunteers associations could do the bidding for the
   autocratic regime. Moreover, the analysis shows how photographers could
   create a visually imagined community, which spanned the great expanse of
   the Russian Empire.},

Abstract = {James Brady was a mid twentieth-century Indigenous political organiser,
   trapper, prospector, writer, and intellectual. He was also a prolific
   photographer. This article considers the significance and aesthetics of
   Brady's photographic archive through the lens of Indigenous visual
   sovereignty. Brady was Metis-one of Canada's three recognised Indigenous
   peoples along with First Nations and Inuit. The Metis engaged in two
   conflicts with the Canadian state and negotiated the entry of a province
   into confederation. For a significant period of history, they lived
   outside Canadian infrastructures, whether the system of First Nations'
   reserves created in the post-treaty era or Euro-Canadian settlements.
   Particularly vulnerable to land loss and displacement, the Metis were in
   desperate condition when Brady first began travelling with his camera.
   Brady's photographs document the political rebirth of Metis people and
   the resilience and persistence of Metis communities in northern Alberta
   and Saskatchewan. They bear photographic witness to the lived experience
   of sovereignty rooted to place and continue to resonate with his
   subjects and their descendants.},

Abstract = {This article casts a retrospective glance at the technological continuum
   from which the art history slide lecture springs. The article focuses
   specifically on the copy apparatuses widely used to make transparencies
   for art-historical consumption, circa 1930 to the early 2000s. The ways
   in which these once prevalent technologies developed to frame and
   disseminate visual materials by means of light was instrumental in
   shaping the widespread illusion of epistemological transparency in the
   world's art history classrooms. In reference to the work of Martin
   Heidegger (1889-1976) on technological determinism, the author provides
   a chronology of slide reproduction technologies in which artworks
   ultimately appear as self-luminous technological `images', or simulated
   entities that speak as if beyond history.},

Abstract = {Although Joe Rosenthal's 1945 Associated Press photograph of US soldiers
   raising an American flag at Mount Suribachi has been the subject of
   countless books and articles, none have discussed in depth the
   circumstances surrounding its publication in Life magazine. First
   published in American newspapers in February 1945, Rosenthal's
   photograph of Iwo Jima was not published in Life until a month later,
   due in part to the editors' scepticism surrounding its authenticity.
   Drawing upon new archival research, this essay recounts the initial
   response of Life's editors to the image, and reveals why they delayed
   publication. Both building on and in dialogue with previous scholarship
   surrounding the production, reproduction, and reception of this historic
   and controversial photograph, this article provides a powerful case
   study of how quickly a single image can be transformed from a
   documentary war photograph into a patriotic representation of American
   triumph in war, and ultimately into a universal, international symbol of
   victory.},

Abstract = {Between 1890 and 1893, two young Americans, Frank Swift Bourns and Dean
   Conant Worcester, travelled through the central and southern Philippines
   on a zoological expedition. In addition to collecting animal specimens,
   the two men took more than one hundred and fifty photographs. These
   photographs have not been given much attention by historians but they
   are an important set of images that help expand the understanding of
   photography in the Philippines in the late Spanish colonial era. This
   article discusses the circumstances surrounding the making of these
   images and provides a framework for interpreting their significance by
   applying the concept of the photographic obsessions' of Western
   explorers as defined and described by Willem van Schendel and his
   colleagues in the book The Chittagong Hill Tracts: Living in a
   Borderland.},

Abstract = {A single glass plate negative formerly in the collection of Howard
   Carter (most famously the excavator of Tutankhamun's tomb) and now in
   the archives of the Griffith Institute, Oxford University raises a
   number of questions about photography, archaeological practice, and the
   creation and use of excavation archives. By following this negative,
   known as Negative VIII, on five of its trajectories through time, media,
   and space, I argue that the reproducibility of the photographic image
   creates a distinct set of issues within archaeology, which has preferred
   to emphasise photography as a unique record of the destructive
   excavation process. Tracing the genealogy of a photographic image
   (rather than the biography of a singular photograph) allows us to
   consider the circulation of photographs as physical objects and through
   public dissemination, as well as the relationship between an image's
   content and its use. The parallel existences of Negative VIII highlight
   the pitfalls and potentials of archival research, where - unless
   adequately recognised - the apparent banality of certain photographs,
   and their replication in multiple forms, may stubbornly confound
   attempts to deconstruct and decolonise the knowledge formations on which
   nineteenth-century Egyptology was built.},

Abstract = {This essay is concerned with photographs produced in the context of
   applying for and issuing passports, permits, passes and identity
   certificates in Southern Africa in the 1920s and 1930s. On the one hand,
   it explores photography as part of a history of a modern state practice
   in order to shed light on the technologies used to regulate mobility and
   assess the place of citizens and subjects. On the other hand, the essay
   shows how men and women applying for identity and travel documents used
   portrait photography as a genre and means to challenge discriminating
   notions of nationality and citizenship enforced by the segregationist
   state. Instead of interpreting the photographs as signature images of
   processes of identity formation and identification, the argument
   developed here aims at sketching the place of visuality within contested
   regimes of personhood. The essay argues that within the bureaucratic
   practices considered, two distinct indexical registers emerged that
   regulated the ways in which colonial citizens and subjects came into
   view: photography and fingerprinting. But while the general argument
   accounts for the alignment of photography with the instrumental power of
   the state apparatus, the close-up engagement in the photographs uncovers
   the possibilities for counter-narratives and alternative subjectivities.},

Abstract = {This paper focuses on the International Photographic Exhibition (Iphad),
   held in Dresden in 1909, offering a case Study to illustrate the
   dynamics of exhibition practice during a time of dramatic artistic and
   social shifts. By the end of the 1920s, a movement known as the `New
   Vision' had emerged in Germany and was on its way to becoming an
   international style, largely through its exposure in high profile
   exhibitions such as HIM und Foto. The New Vision rejected the pre-war
   mode of Pictorialist photography with its reliance oil static subjects
   and methods borrowed front nineteenth-century painting. But rather than
   being a sudden development of the late 1920s, the new ways of exhibiting
   photography that fed into the New Vision's expansive and
   non-hierarchical approach can be traced back to Iphad, Where critics
   were stunned by the sheer variety of material on display. This earlier
   critique of Pictorialism was Sociocultural as well as technical in
   character and involved dialectics Of juxtaposition, rigorous debates,
   and jockeying for influence, as is demonstrated through analysis of
   accompanying publications, installation shots, and published critical
   reception. This establishes the developmental roots of many elements of
   the New Vision and its display before it gained international prominence

Abstract = {More than 2000 human beings were brought to the Louisiana Purchase
   Exhibition of 1904 in St. Louis, MO, as human exhibits. Having travelled
   to the universal exposition from across the globe, the people lived in
   villages that also functioned as anthropological displays. While they
   have been correctly constructed as marking the divide between modern and
   primitive so central to the fair's meanings, this essay argues further
   that, within the over-determined photographic and performative spectacle
   of Expo 1904, sites of resistant insubordination were located by the
   anthropological subjects, whereby they asserted agency over their own
   representation by shifting their living performances in often subtle and
   complex manners. At this moment, when photography itself expanded
   dramatically, the photographic archive has captured a layer of meaning
   at universal expositions that is significant and has yet to be fully
   articulated.},

Title = {Placing Early Photography: The Work of Robert Hunt in
   Mid-Nineteenth-Century Britain},
Journal = {HISTORY OF PHOTOGRAPHY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {41},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {343-361},
Abstract = {The invention of photography in the late 1830s is conventionally framed
   in terms of simultaneous rival developments by a few well-known figures
   in England and France. Less attention has been paid to how early
   photography was shaped by a wider cast of individuals placed in both
   metropolitan and regional networks of science and applied arts. Drawing
   in particular on recent studies on networks and the geography of
   science, this article examines the significant but frequently overlooked
   contributions made to early photography by the chemist and popular
   science writer Robert Hunt (1807-87) as a way to open up questions about
   the spatial networks of early photography. Based in southwest Britain,
   and from a relatively humble background, Hunt experimented widely with
   early photographic processes. He used correspondence with key figures of
   Victorian science, notably Sir John Herschel, to share his knowledge and
   build a reputation within influential networks of early science and
   publishing. This article argues that Hunt's foundational contributions
   to early photography - which were widely recognised in the half century
   after his death - need to be better appreciated and understood within
   the setting of spatial networks of science and applied arts at various
   scales. These include regional networks, such as those in Cornwall;
   metropolitan circles in London; national networks, such as the British
   Association for the Advancement of Science; and national and
   international networks of publishers and readers. As an examination of
   Hunt's work demonstrates, accounts of early photography may profit from
   paying more attention to the networks and places in which photographers,
   photographs and writings on photography were located.},

Abstract = {Between the 1930s and the 1990s, as art museums across the USA began
   contending with what place photography might hold within their
   programmes, key individuals framed photography's value in language that
   itself deserves consideration. Amid this museological reckoning with the
   medium, at the National Gallery of Art, which was established in the
   1930s as a national public repository for Western art of the highest
   standards, the question of whether and how photography might fit into
   that lineage presented new questions. How would the greatness of
   photography be defined? What would its presentation look like? Sarah
   Greenough joined the National Gallery of Art in 1978 with a PhD in Art
   History and an expertise in the work of Alfred Stieglitz. I argue that
   as she aimed to integrate photography seamlessly into the set of values
   established by Andrew W. Mellon at the founding of the Gallery, she drew
   upon Stieglitz's own terminology for valuing the medium, modelling her
   own philosophy of its import on his notion of `the idea photography'.},

Abstract = {This article examines the photographic career of Stefano Lecchi, the
   Italian photographer best known for his series of photographs
   documenting the aftermath of the defence of the Roman Republic in 1849,
   a key episode in Italy's nationalist movement, the Risorgimento. This
   study concentrates on the album Fotografi di Roma, which presents thirty
   of Lecchi's salted paper prints from that series together with eleven
   topographical views. This album demonstrates how the events of the
   Risorgimento expanded the existing canon of Italy's historical monuments
   to include new sites identified with contemporary political actions that
   in turn contributed to the collective memory of the founding of the
   nation. Using newly discovered biographical information and highlighting
   the transnational network of colleagues and patrons surrounding this
   album, the author proposes the significance of these photographs to
   Italian nation-building across the political spectrum and posits Lecchi
   as an important, although often neglected, figure in the early
   development of paper photography.},

Abstract = {This article presents the third census of H. Fox Talbot's The Pencil of
   Nature (1844-46), the first commercially published photographically
   illustrated book. The first census was published in the Introductory
   Volume to the 1989 Anniversary Facsimile of The Pencil of Nature, the
   first complete examination of this seminal work. The publication of that
   census provoked the discovery of a number of new copies, and an updated
   census was published in History of Photography in 1993. Since that time,
   additional copies have emerged and quite a few changes of ownership have
   come about, leading to this third census. Since the original copies of
   The Pencil of Nature were assembled by hand, variations occurred, and
   defects in the original binding and later owners' actions led to
   bibliographic confusion about what constituted an authentic copy. This
   question is considered in a brief bibliographical summary and analysis.
   Potential copies and known missing copies are enumerated in the hopes of
   promoting their discovery in future.},

Journal = {HISTORY OF PHOTOGRAPHY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {34},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {134-146},
Abstract = {African historians' interest in photographic sources is still rather
   recent and can be traced back to the mid-1980s. Today, after more than
   twenty years of research, we know the general outlines of the history of
   African photography, but have yet to move beyond the larger picture. In
   having a close look at some centres of the early history of West and
   Central African photography such as Sierra Leone, Fernando Po and Gabon,
   as well as at the professional careers of African photographers such as
   Francis W. Joaque, this paper will contribute to a better and deeper
   understanding of the early history of West African and Central African
   photography. Research using and comparing photographs and textual
   sources from the archive of the Atlantic Visualscape displays a world
   and a time between 1850 and 1900 when African photographers moved beyond
   cultural, political and linguistic boundaries to explore potentials in
   an increasingly competitive market.},

   Multiplex Hologram},
Journal = {HISTORY OF PHOTOGRAPHY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {35},
Number = {1},
Pages = {23-32},
Abstract = {Nothing seems more self-evident than the difference between still and
   moving images. But there are technologies that undermine this
   difference. One case is the multiplex hologram. After a technical
   introduction - which explains the technology and why its images are
   still and moving, depending on the relative movement between image and
   observer - three cultural occurrences of the multiplex hologram are
   discussed: one in the work of surrealist Salvador Dali, one in an essay
   of Umberto Eco on hyperreality and, finally, in the 1976 science-fiction
   movie Logan's Run. In each case the multiplex hologram occupies a place
   beyond `ordinary' reality. Based on these three case studies, I will
   argue that the construction of categorical oppositions like moving/still
   in relation to images is often connected to a naturalised and therefore
   problematic ontology. This will lead to the argument that the careful
   work of historiography must precede theoretical constructions.},

Title = {Images in Exile: Lucia Moholy's Bauhaus Negatives and the Construction
   of the Bauhaus Legacy},
Journal = {HISTORY OF PHOTOGRAPHY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {37},
Number = {2},
Pages = {182-203},
Month = {MAY 1},
Abstract = {This article argues that photographs of the Bauhaus its architecture and
   design objects taken by Lucia Moholy played a key role in establishing
   the school during the short period of its existence, but that they took
   on heightened significance in exile, during the post-war period in which
   the Bauhaus's legacy was solidified. As Bauhaus members fled Germany in
   the 1930s, what they were able to take with them formed a
   disproportionate part of their oeuvre thereafter; what was no longer
   extant was often lost to the footnotes of history. Lucia Moholy was
   forced to leave behind her entire collection of original glass negatives
   in Berlin when she escaped into exile in 1933. What followed in which
   the negatives she thought lost became the core of the visual archive
   deployed by Walter Gropius in the subsequent narration of the Bauhaus
   demonstrates the exigencies of exile, especially the lacunae created by
   objects left behind upon emigration, and how photography as a medium
   became crucial to the later reception of the closed school and what had
   been produced there. By examining this constellation of circumstances,
   this article illuminates shifts in notions of authorship and in the
   signification of objects. It argues that processes of meaning-formation
   for exiled artists of the Bauhaus were closely tied to the power
   involved in the ability to reproduce photographs, specifically Lucia
   Moholy's photographs, and for the importance of the photograph as a
   stand-in for that which was no longer accessible or extant.},

Abstract = {This article analyses Martin Chambi's photographs at Machu Picchu. At a
   time when pre-Columbian ruins were a key element of national and
   regional identity formation in Peru, used to engage with the role
   diverse ethnicities should play in new social and political relations,
   Chambi's work offers a privileged lens for studying the role of
   photography in terms of marshalling the material past. Some images
   Chambi took at Machu Picchu offer a set of tropes for a photographic
   aesthetics of ruins - one indicative of the way the site continues to be
   venerated as an object lost in the past by contemporary photographers.
   Other images, however, not least his self-portraits and group
   photographs, depict a more historically aware, tactile and, unusually,
   enjoyable relationship to ruins.},

Abstract = {This essay deals with the way Palestinian villages, emptied during the
   1948 war when their inhabitants fled or were expelled, were visually
   preserved in Israeli consciousness. The essay analyses a group of
   photographs in official Israeli archives that were taken by Israeli
   photographers between 1948 and 1951. These images, taken for Israeli
   national propaganda to describe the new Jewish immigrants who had been
   settled by the new Israeli state in these villages, show how they
   implement the Zionist world view. In contrast to these purposes,
   however, reading these institutional photography archives also makes it
   possible to learn about Palestinian identity before 1948 and gain
   insight into the Palestinian people, who are missing from these
   photographs. The essay shows how the manner of reading these archives
   makes possible the extraction of different layers of meanings.},

Abstract = {Photography reached the Ottoman Empire soon after its invention, at
   about the time that painting began to be practised there as part of a
   broader project of assimilating aspects of European culture. This was in
   marked contrast to the Situation in Europe, where photography had to
   contend with Visual traditions from which it adopted pictorial
   conventions and Subject matter. Instead of Supplanting existing
   traditions of realistic visual representation, photography in the
   Ottoman Empire served as a discrete source of inspiration. This paper
   examines how this inversion of European experience within the Ottoman
   Empire provides an alternative to dominant narratives of photographic
   history. If one of the salient characteristics of modernist movements in
   Western art is their ability to break with tradition, then the adoption
   of Western practices of representation by artists within the Ottoman
   Empire may be viewed as a radical modernist Success.},

Abstract = {Following the Constitutional Revolution of 1906, Iran entered two
   decades of turmoil and deteriorating conditions that endangered the very
   existence of the country as a sovereign state. The coup d'etat of 1921
   set the stage for a rapid transition into a new era that was signified
   by the end of the ruling Qajar Dynasty. The central and catalysing agent
   was the Cossack officer Reza Khan, who later became the first monarch of
   the Pahlavi Dynasty. This article addresses the last years of the Qajar
   era, from the coup to the official annulment of the one hundred and
   thirty year old dynasty. In the wake of World War I and the undesired
   entry of Iran into the feud between the Ottomans, Russians and the
   British, and with a weak central government, the country was on the
   verge of disintegration. Photography had found new venues of
   manifestation during the Revolution and was finding more clients among
   what was to be the nucleus of a future urban middle class (ca. 1910),
   but it remained elitist. A number of photographic projects of the last
   four years of the Qajar era have survived in the form of commissioned
   photo-albums. This article examines three albums and sheds light upon
   the agenda that may have been behind such projects. Postcards, posters,
   banners and photographically illustrated books published during this
   period are also examined.},

Abstract = {Founding curator of the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Department of
   Photographs, Maria Morris Hambourg's impact on the field of photography
   is incalculable. Across a multi-decade career, Hambourg influenced the
   canon of photography through largely monographic exhibitions. I use the
   terms searchlight and lighthouse as metaphors to describe her influence
   on curation and scholarship as well as the passion that focused her
   in-depth research. Hambourg's interest in the print process and
   photographic papers in tandem with historical context has been an
   important model for the generations of photography historians and
   curators that succeeded her. A committed expert on nineteenth-century
   France, Hambourg built relationships with photography collectors and
   conducted material and biographical research on artists such as Eug \&
   egrave;ne Atget, Nadar and Gustave Le Gray. Acknowledging her focus on
   European, white male photographers, I position Hambourg's exhibitions
   and writing as an important foundation for later research and
   scholarship that more thoroughly untangles histories of power, race and
   class, within the same canon she helped construct.},

Title = {The Mechanical against Objectivity: Industrialism and Inoperativity in
   Eadweard Muybridge's <i>Animal Locomotion</i> (1887)},
Journal = {HISTORY OF PHOTOGRAPHY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {47},
Number = {3},
Pages = {203-233},
Month = {JUL 3},
Abstract = {Throughout his 1887 photographic atlas, Animal Locomotion, the
   photographer Eadweard Muybridge uses the serial, instantaneous imagery
   of chronophotography - a medium typically associated with the automated
   mechanisms of industrial productivity and scientific analysis - against
   the economies for which it was developed. This article aims to identify
   a subcategory of works in the series termed `inoperative images',
   meaning photographs that both depict non-productive gestures - such as
   dancing, posing and lying down - as well as those sequences that, thanks
   to mechanical failures, inconsistent time intervals or the rearrangement
   of plates, ultimately proved useless for physiological analysis. Where
   previous scholars have attributed Muybridge's lack of rigorously applied
   scientific method to a desire for an aesthetic product, these
   inoperative images may also be understood as creative resistance to the
   mechanisation and industrialisation of photographic labour in the last
   quarter of the nineteenth century. In this context, a different
   understanding of Animal Locomotion as an anti-industrial document comes
   to light, one that illustrates how the mechanical may work against the
   goals of purpose-driven, standardised time and objectivity.},

Abstract = {Robert Rauschenberg was a tireless maker of works of art, but he was
   also an insatiable consumer of photographic images, which he
   appropriated from contemporary newspapers and illustrated magazines.
   This study examines photographs from the print media that he
   incorporated into his combines in the 1950s and considers how those
   contribute to the design, fabrication and meaning of his work. A premise
   of the paper is that Odalisk, Rebus, Small Rebus and contemporaneous
   works repay sustained looking. In essence, it argues that Brian
   O'Doherty's notion of the `vernacular glance' circumscribed viewers'
   reception and analysis of Rauschenberg's work.},

Abstract = {This paper is concerned with the roles played by photographs in the
   creation of fresh images. After touching on the impact made by Northern
   European paintings and prints on the development of Renaissance art in
   Italy, it examines broadly the usefulness of works of art on paper -
   including photographs - in disseminating local styles and subject
   matter. The body of the paper examines how Robert Rauschenberg, Andy
   Warhol and Richard Hamilton appropriated photographic images in the
   1950s and 1960s, and asks to what extent such borrowed images continued
   to resonate when imported into different milieus. In essence, the paper
   asks whether those images continued to `pierce', `prick' or `bruise' the
   viewer in their new environments - to borrow terms Roland Barthes
   employed to characterise the effect of the punctum. The paper also
   suggests that on occasion the new work of art may supersede the regional
   nature of its source materials, giving the originating images a global
   currency that transcends their origins.},

Abstract = {This study elucidates the Virgilian epigraph on the title page of the
   first fascicle of The Pencil of Nature, first by situating it in the
   context of Henry Fox Talbot's education and, secondly, by placing it in
   the larger setting of classical culture in Georgian and Victorian
   England. The article concludes that the epigraph Talbot selected for The
   Pencil of Nature was embedded in the classical consciousness of his
   public school and university educated contemporaries, while also
   recalling venerable chapters in the British literary heritage.},

Volume = {37},

Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {In 1860, Roger Fenton exhibited a distinctive set of photographic still
   lifes. Little did viewers of the time know that these would be among his
   last photographs. Technically accomplished, large in format and
   expensively priced, the prints of fruit and flowers - some including
   plaster figurines - stretched the limits of the photographic medium by
   transforming the look of monochrome. Although in some ways strikingly
   atypical, in their rendering the black and white' medium newly
   commensurate with a popular genre, the sumptuous still lifes perpetuate
   a vital connection with the medium of sculpture characteristic of
   Fenton's earlier photographs. That connection emerges in the propensity
   of such photographs to petrify - turn to stone as it were - those
   objects they capture while simultaneously holding their potential for
   subsequent metamorphosis. Such a quality of transformation, most
   obviously present in Fenton's photographs of antiquities in the British
   Museum, is also at work in his landscapes. Indeed, as the natural world
   is petrified in his views of north Wales, Fenton highlights the implicit
   metamorphosis within the apparent stasis, or characteristic immobility,
   of the photographic image.},

Abstract = {In 2020, the Baltimore Police Department used aerial surveillance camera
   technology, dubbed the `spy plane', that recorded the movements of
   nearly every citizen from above. Based on direct observation inside the
   programme's operations centre, this article shows how a `grainy truth'
   aesthetic, created by engineers to combat criticisms of the programme's
   invasiveness, also influenced the actual labour of surveillance. An
   obsession in the public debate and within the operations centre about
   how the imagery looks, however, overshadowed the most worrisome aspect
   of the programme: its infrastructure of representation. City officials
   are now saddled with managing a massive database of citizen location
   data owned by a private company, prompting difficult questions about the
   privatisation of policing.},

Abstract = {This article analyses the work of Colombian photographer Fernell Franco
   through a comparative study with the work of Mexican cinematographer
   Gabriel Figueroa. Through the vast production and dissemination of the
   melodramatic genre, Mexican cinema became a paradigmatic referent for
   some artists working in the context of a radical urban transformation in
   the cities of Colombia during the second half of the twentieth century.
   Indeed, Franco's work developed simultaneously with his close
   relationship to and immense fascination with popular Mexican cinema.
   This article utilises the notion of melodrama as a `fictional system'
   that permeated the work of Franco, drawing upon Mexican movies'
   mise-en-scene, dramatic lighting and the close relationship between two
   Mexican melodrama subgenres: the vecindad (tenement) and the
   prostitute's story. The article proposes two ways of understanding
   Franco's images. On the one hand, they speak about the conditions of
   displacement in Colombia and, on the other, they characterise what has
   been termed the `tropical gothic'. Lastly, the article discusses the
   importance of postproduction techniques and materiality in Franco's
   work, focusing specifically on the Interiors series.},

Abstract = {During the decades around the turn of the twentieth century, tens of
   thousands of photographs were taken in Samoa by professional and amateur
   photographers. Because the production and consumption of photographs
   from this period are normally regarded as fundamentally western
   activities, these photographs are often mined exclusively for the
   information they yield about western attitudes and meanings. Yet, given
   that most of these photographs featured Samoans, they would have been
   intimately involved in the photographic process that created these
   images. Disregarding this aspect ignores the possibility that these
   photographs can also be expressive of Samoan socio-cultural values. This
   article analyses a selection of photographs of Mata'afa Iosefo, the high
   chief of Samoa, taken by a German scientist stationed in Samoa between
   1902 and 1905. It regards the photographic process as a space of
   cultural encounter and therefore reads these images as documents of the
   complex interplay of coloniser and colonised that characterised German
   Samoa.},

Abstract = {This paper discusses the work of the contemporary German-born artists
   Steffi Klenz and Thomas Weinberger, who share an interest in making
   strange' as a device for bringing to visibility the processes that shape
   our environment. Klenz and Weinberger belong to a generation of young
   photographers who, across a considerable variety of subject matter and
   technique, have been challenging the categories of urban' and
   landscape'; they have also been investing in processes of ambiguation
   through their work, offering an open space for the viewer's own
   projection and engagement. Quite distinct in focus and technique, Klenz
   and Weinberger turn away from urban life as action in order to meditate
   on the spaces where it unfolds. Their work shows complex modes of
   construction, appropriation and destruction of contemporary urban
   landscapes and their representations. The work of the two artists is
   discussed alongside ideas of the homely and the strange as devices of
   re-cognition, and is situated in the context of contemporary
   photographic practice that rethinks ways in which we look at our
   environment.},

Abstract = {This article examines the implications of the surrealist appropriation
   and re-circulation of a crime-scene photograph depicting the body of
   Mary Kelly, Jack the Ripper's final victim. The article traces the
   trajectory of the photograph, taken in 1888, as it shifts from its role
   as a visual police record in London, to evidence of sexual sadism in the
   developing field of criminology in France, before finally becoming an
   object in the text of a play, `Regards sur l'enfer anthropoclasique', by
   surrealist Maurice Heine, and being published in 1936 along with that
   play in Minotaure, a luxury art review. As it is re-framed in various
   contexts, however, the photograph retains some of its prior meaning. A
   key point in the argument is that this kind of appropriation reveals how
   photographic meaning is produced and anchored.},

Abstract = {Laszlo Moholy-Nagy came to Chicago to head the New Bauhaus in 1937 after
   the Nazis closed the school in Dessau. By the time the USA became
   involved in the war, investors had forced the school to change its name
   from the New Bauhaus to the American School of Design - a change that
   resulted directly from US ambivalence toward foreign, and especially
   German, influence. Of course, the school's name was not the only change
   brought by the war. A study of the wartime context of Chicago industry
   and politics, as well as the school's unique photographic pedagogy based
   on the photogram and its application to visual war strategies, reveals a
   fascinating attempt to convert an interdisciplinary Bauhaus curriculum
   based on the melding of art and industry into an artistic contribution
   to Chicago's war industry. This article investigates how the
   interdisciplinary pedagogy of the Bauhaus was influenced by its new
   context in the heart of US industrial markets, and how the war affected
   both the city and the course of the school, its faculty and students.
   The article discusses how photographic pedagogy was adapted from its
   modernist origins to address the most pressing question facing the art
   school - namely, how artists could productively contribute to wartime
   efforts. Pedagogy based on mastering light and shadow was directly
   applied to new theories of combat vision and camouflage techniques
   developed by the faculty alongside numerous military guest lecturers,
   while students and faculty used art as a source of catharsis, producing
   haunting wartime images of destruction.},

   catalogue accompanying C/O Berlin's fall 2023 one-person show of her
   photography, Encounters (16 September 2023-18 January 2024). I should
   have been better prepared after one friend familiar with C/O Berlin
   doubted after reading my draft that they would publish anything
   insufficiently laudatory. Thus forewarned, I was especially pleased by
   the initial positive response of C/O curators to the text I submitted
   three months ahead of press time. They warned me they were on a tight
   schedule and precisely because I like the idea of mixing up a
   predictably laudatory monograph with a more reflective essay, I made a
   point of meeting every request for cuts and revisions.Given my
   determined hoop-jumping, I thought all was going swimmingly when we had
   passed the official deadline of 1 July for submission to Steidl and they
   already had wired their fee to my bank. Then, on 10 July, an email
   appeared on my laptop titled `bad news' - I would be happy to quote it
   verbatim except that might open me to suit. In so many words, the
   message explained that when the curatorial team very recently submitted
   the entire typeset text to the Mary Ellen Mark Foundation, they
   encountered strong objections to my essay. They allowed that if they
   were not pressed for time to have a catalogue in hand by the September
   opening, there might be compromises. But up against the deadline - for
   some reason they had not mentioned back in April that this ultimately
   would get vetted by the photographer's foundation on which they depended
   for prints and use of reproduction, and strangely they only sought final
   approval just before going to press even though they had a draft of my
   text much earlier - they resolved to simply axe the essay and hoped that
   the writer's fee already wired to my bank would now serve as a kill
   fee.When I asked for more details about the Foundation's objection that
   my essay had too many factual errors, the comments I was shown, except
   for one minor issue, consisted of protests to my interpretations. I had
   hardly concealed my judgements, but I also thought I had given clear
   reasons for them. I also thought that some readers might be impressed
   that I not only considered the work seriously, but also, after starting
   off questioning Mark's self-described documentary mantle, I ultimately
   conceded a documentary attribute to Mark's doubled portraits. Clearly
   the Foundation folks could tolerate no criticism of work or approach by
   their hallowed subject. In an era when censorship seems to rise to
   epidemic proportions, I resolved to find an alternative platform.I have
   been on a portrait kick lately and I happen to think that this text
   makes a useful companion essay, if arguably somewhat contradictory, to
   one I researched, wrote and actually had published during the pandemic
   period of enforced isolation.1 It remains my hope that followers of
   photography and contemporary image-making might have access to more than
   hagiographic cant that foundations controlling rights to reproduction
   seem to foster. I like to think this article offers a salutary attempt
   to take photographic portraiture seriously but with none of the rhetoric
   of idealised revelations that gloss the transaction initiated usually by
   the photographer. We hardly need more reflexive affirmations that
   already gild the photographic pantheon. If my article generates public
   refutation as well as expansions on these ideas, all the better.
   In my opinion, photographic discourse could use more bite and less balm
   to counter the hoary rhetoric of photographic pictures being either a
   universal language or the proverbial equivalent of a thousand words.},

Abstract = {This article focuses on the photographs of public sculptures used on
   belle epoque picture postcards of Brussels. The subject is approached
   from two perspectives. Firstly, we analyse the conventions of in situ
   photography of public sculpture in light of the genre's reliance on
   painterly and photographic traditions, as well as its adoption of visual
   strategies derived from amateur and snapshot photography. Secondly, we
   explore the role of the photographic mise-en-scene of picture postcards
   in constructing an ideological as well as visual perspective on public
   monuments and the cityscape. The in situ photography of urban statues
   for picture postcards can be regarded as a photographic genre at the
   intersection of documentary art reproduction practices and amateur
   photography of the city. Moreover, the picture postcards discussed in
   this essay confirm and propagate dominant discourses on the monument and
   the cityscape, even if at the same time such visions were challenged. In
   the case of Brussels, the postcards demonstrate a preference for a
   monumental, impressive cityscape, worthy of representing the Belgian
   nation and capable of legitimising it through views of sculpture as a
   grand art, serving the worship of grands hommes.},

Abstract = {This essay argues that the photographic style known as Neue Sachlichkeit
   was in part a product of the educational ambitions of photographic
   archives in early twentieth-century Germany. While these archives first
   developed this approach to photography as a tool for visual
   investigation and analysis, Neue Sachlichkeit photography has since been
   separated from its pragmatic origins. The essay connects the dramatic
   close-ups and uncommon viewing angles found in these archives to Neue
   Sachlichkeit photography, thus contributing to recent reconsiderations
   of the boundaries between photographic document and artistic style.},

Abstract = {This article is prompted by the remarkable characteristic of
   nineteenth-century Scotland that circumstances congregate to give an
   unprecedentedly generous or democratic view of life. Four forms of
   communication the statistical accounts, which were followed by the
   British census records, the boom in publishing, especially in newspapers
   and journals, and inexpensive communication promoted by the penny post,
   even the information in street directories and advertisements all
   combine with the exploitation of photography to give us insights, which
   can be disconcertingly specific, acting as occasional spotlights on the
   landscape. This article is prompted by one particular letter from Robert
   Louis Stevenson, written when he was a young man, and is followed
   through two lines of connected thought: the practice of studio
   photography in Scotland and Stevenson's continuing interest in the
   photographic portrait.},

Abstract = {Situated in the historic centre of the city of Edinburgh, scenic Calton
   Hill, and the view from the Hill, has been subject to the gaze of
   painters and photographers. This article examines the drawn, painted and
   photographic panoramas associated with the site. In tracing the course
   of this imagery, the author defines the notion of the panoramic in terms
   of perspective (the wide field-of-view) and of history (the passage of
   time).},

Abstract = {Recent practice of staged photography in China renders views of urban
   landscapes as active elements in performative actions directed for the
   camera. These cityscapes, featured in photographs produced by artists
   such as Li Wei, Cao Fei, Chi Peng and Xing Danwen, not only reflect the
   country's rapid urbanisation but also ongoing processes of
   globalisation. The same processes reconfigure time-space relations
   around the globe and offer an opportunity to decentre' the world, but
   they equally escape capture and document in real time. Fictional
   photographic elaborations of their accompanying elements, such as the
   technologisation of culture and the inability to fix a stable image of
   the future, provide a point of departure to explore photography's role
   in response to the challenges posed by global urban living. This issue
   also creates a space for rethinking the critical potential of the
   medium.},

Abstract = {Photographic book production in Germany in the interwar period reveals
   immense inconsistencies and divergent trends. Predominant themes involve
   a shifting discourse between a pessimistic nostalgia for an apparently
   disappearing, slower pace of life and a more optimistic, technological
   utopianism, with dividing lines set between the old and the new, the
   urban and the rural, and between progress' and tradition'. As the
   National Socialist era approached, however, there was a largely
   successful assimilation of these disparate, antagonistic elements of
   German culture in an attempt to create a sense of continuity rather than
   disruption. Collectively, photographic books provide a register of
   conflicting, contemporary concerns and anxieties. This article
   investigates how their variant discourses point to the complex realities
   of German interwar cultural politics.},

Year = {2014},
Volume = {38},
Number = {1},
Pages = {73-93},
Abstract = {This article critically examines the landscape and cityscape photography
   of E. O. Hoppe. In Picturesque Great Britain (1926), Hoppe presented a
   vision of the nation refracted through the prism of an older
   Pictorialist aesthetic, whereas his later works, Romantic America (1927)
   and Deutsche Arbeit (1930), offered a more enthusiastic interpretation
   of the urban industrial world. Indeed, the latter volume is very much in
   the style of Die Neue Sachlichkeit. Hoppe's photography is, therefore,
   characterised by a high level of visual mutability as he shifted styles
   to suit publication needs, and he appears a particularly adept
   commercial opportunist. Elsewhere, Hoppe's work appeared simultaneously
   in contexts that rejected the technological utopianism of the New
   Objectivity and Amerikanismus. In Germany, American Zivilisation was
   often understood to be a threat to a more traditional Kultur, and
   Hoppe's work was also published in contexts characterised by a
   reactionary modernism that aimed at a reconciliation of the old with the
   new. This article analyses the cultural, commercial and ideological
   forces that helped shape Hoppe's work in Britain, Germany and the United
   States.},

   O. Hoppe and the novelist J. D. Beresford that resulted in the
   publication of Taken from Life (1922), a book combining both
   photographic and literary typologies of the metropolitan lower classes.
   Here, Taken from Life is situated within its authors' respective careers
   and considered within the broader discourses of class differentiation
   and Social Darwinism active in Britain in the 1920s. The author argues
   that Taken from Life is permeated by a superficially benign, but
   ultimately paternalistic `class tourism', a form of voyeurism that
   derives from its uneasy combination of sociological speculation with
   both anecdote and fiction.},

Abstract = {This article examines the career of the photographer Felice Beato in
   Burma from 1886 to 1905. It examines, on one level, his photographic
   business in Burma through a consideration of his portfolio and his
   business practices. On a more important level, it examines Beato's
   representation of Burma through visual and contextual analysis of his
   photographs of the Burmese people. It discusses this topic in the
   context of Beato's entire photographic career, his non-photographic
   preoccupations, and nineteenth-century commercial photographic
   production and consumption, as well as considering ways in which his
   photographs were used in travel literature. The core argument of this
   study is that Beato's desire to cater to consumer demands was a key
   element in shaping his photographic production, both in terms of his
   imaging strategies and his business practices. His photographic
   representation of Burma was thus closely tied to the context of its
   production and consumption. Essentially, Beato's representation of Burma
   can be understood as a commodification of the Burmese experience for the
   consumer. This commodification entailed depicting Burma in picturesque
   conventions - as a series of familiar, pleasing, and ultimately saleable
   pictures.},

Abstract = {In the summer of 1966, the Japanese artist Yayoi Kusama installed
   Narcissus Garden in the main grounds of the 33rd Venice Biennale.
   Fifteen hundred mirrored plastic balls formed the core of a dynamic,
   complex work, which also included human agents, environmentally
   determined, ephemeral elements, and photographic images. The common
   thread, however, was the presence of the artist herself, captured for
   posterity in nearly every existing photograph of Narcissus Garden. Taken
   collectively, these images of Kusama and her work create a complicated
   amalgam of self-publicity and effacement, presenting a complex fusion of
   artist, image, and object. Photographs do not supplement the sculpture,
   Narcissus Garden, but function as an integral component of the work,
   acting as the connective tissue amongst its multiple parts.},

Abstract = {In 1942 photographer Andreas Feininger travelled across the United
   States documenting war industries for the Office of War Information, a
   New Deal agency. In the midst of world war, Feininger's straightforward
   photographs of plane production, copper mining, and other key industries
   were carefully crafted propaganda designed to combat German rhetoric and
   bolster public support and confidence in the war effort. Feininger's
   style, an admixture of modernist ideas and social detachment, found
   resonance within US ideological efforts that stressed data and facts,
   and became known as the `Strategy of Truth'.},

Abstract = {William James Stillman led a remarkable life, with stints as an artist,
   journalist, diplomat and spy. He also used photography in innovative
   ways to document the Athenian Acropolis. In college Stillman developed a
   special interest in classical studies, and he went on to befriend
   American and European intellectual luminaries. Most important for his
   aesthetic formation was John Ruskin, who became a close friend. Although
   the personal connection foundered, Ruskin's principles continued to
   inform Stillman's approach to art. In 1855 Stillman cofounded The
   Crayon, the first serious American journal of the arts. Then he embarked
   on a career as a diplomat, being posted as consul to Crete in 1865. Due
   to his support of a Cretan revolt against Ottoman rule, he had to flee
   in 1868 to Athens with his wife and children. Although his family was
   battered by a series of tragedies, Stillman undertook to photograph the
   monuments on the Acropolis. A selection of twenty-five photographs was
   published in London in 1870 as The Acropolis of Athens Illustrated
   Picturesquely and Architecturally in Photography. Stillman's photographs
   are unlike others produced at that time. His amateur status freed him
   from the professional's obligation to make pictures that conformed to a
   buyer's expectations. He could therefore explore unexpected angles and
   points of view on the Acropolis. Stillman did so with the double aim of
   demonstrating refinements in the artistry and construction of the
   monuments, and, more broadly, of expressing his idealization of ancient
   Athens and his larger artistic and political concerns. I contend that
   the album is meant to be read sequentially as an exposition of what
   Stillman saw as the uniquely Greek amalgam of art and democracy.},

Month = {FAL},
Abstract = {This article treats the art and writings of Antoni Wieczorek, one of the
   most influential figures in Polish photography of the 1930s. Whilst
   belonging to the pictorialist amateurs, Wieczorek criticised this very
   circle in numerous texts and argued, in contrast to the pictorialist
   credo, for photography as a utilitarian undertaking connected to current
   events. In his articles he underscored repeatedly the necessity of
   bringing photographic creativity to the mass market. The essential task
   of the photographer, he maintained, was the production of `artistic
   illustrations' for books and the press. Such views, articulated from the
   early 1930s, anticipate by several years the programme of Homeland
   Photography (fotografia ojczysta), consecrated by Jan Bulhak in 1937, in
   emulation of a German model, as a pictorial movement to further national
   propaganda. Homeland Photography set as its goal the documentation of
   Polish landscape, folklore, and architectural monuments, both past and
   present. As a result of the movement's documentary activities, in which
   Wieczorek played an important role, a new, idealized vision of the
   country emerged that promoted Poland's traditional values of nobility
   and folklore together with its nascent sites of heavy industry.},

Pages = {141-158},
Abstract = {This article analyses Henry Peach Robinson's method of making composite
   photographs in the context of widespread belief that the photographer's
   `mechanism' was perceptible in the appearance of his prints. By
   examining Robinson's preparatory and darkroom procedures, as well as the
   photographer's extensive writing about his photographic practice, I
   suggest that composite photographs invited viewers to pay attention to
   process, and to take it into account in their evaluation of an image.
   This attitude challenged key tenets of academic art theory - the
   paradigm for nascent concepts of art in photography - by refusing to
   subordinate manual labour to that of the mind. While many
   nineteenth-century critics rejected Robinson's approach, the debates
   engendered by composite techniques reveal a persistent fascination with
   making that advanced photographic practice as a marker of artistic
   value.},

Abstract = {This article explores the ways in which photography was used by the
   colonial state in Malaya to promote the supposed success of resettlement
   - the counterinsurgency scheme through which around half a million
   people were forcibly moved into camps, later renamed `New Villages',
   during the Malayan Emergency (1948-60). While this study engages with
   the ways in which the racialised category of the `squatter' - that is,
   rural Chinese who were the main object of resettlement - was reflected
   in official photography, it also argues for the need to consider such
   photography within broader developments in photographic practice and
   consumption in Southeast Asia during the early 1950s. These include the
   role of local Malayan photographers as part of the state propaganda
   apparatus and the emergence of Humanist photojournalism as a mode of
   expression in the same period. In doing this, the article suggests that
   the interaction between colonial photography and commercial
   photojournalism in Malaya complicates the extant literature on the
   `colonial gaze' while contributing to an emerging body of research on
   the tensions between colonialism and Humanism in early postwar
   photography.},

Abstract = {This article explores the importance of portrait photography to the
   wartime collaborationist regime of Wang Jingwei, which governed parts of
   Japanese-occupied China from 1940 to 1945. The article demonstrates how,
   for a combination of practical, political, and cultural reasons, studio
   portraiture was chosen as one of the primary forms of media for the
   propagation of iconography by this administration. Studio portraiture
   was also, however, a realm in which this Chinese regime sought to stamp
   its own mark on visual culture, separate from the iconography of the
   occupying Japanese. The article demonstrates this by tracing the origins
   and fate of a number of widely circulated studio portraits of Wang taken
   in 1939, 1940, and 1941. This article also speculates about the
   possibility of identifying and defining an ?occupied lens? during the
   war, one which was clearly derivative of prewar forms yet evolved in
   ways which set it apart both from Japanese propaganda and from the
   visual culture of resistance.},

Title = {The Big Picture: The Materiality of Size in Ansel Adams's Large-Scale
   Works},
Journal = {HISTORY OF PHOTOGRAPHY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {43},
Number = {4},
Pages = {380-398},

Abstract = {The prominence of the large-format photograph in contemporary art since
   the 1970s is often attributed to the desire to explore new pictorial and
   spatial avenues by moving beyond the documentary approaches that had
   dominated since the 1930s. While not an inaccurate characterisation, the
   focus upon the artistic impulses associated with large-scale photography
   comes at the expense of the material issues that enabled it. This
   article addresses the gap by examining two largely overlooked forms
   produced by Ansel Adams between 1930 and 1960 - the photomural and the
   folding photo-screen - in order to demonstrate the high level of direct
   engagement that existed between photographer and materiality, which
   resulted in large-scale works that addressed many of the same issues
   dealt with in contemporary large-format photography, but that also stood
   in stark contrast to the ephemeral, mass-produced, large-scale work
   prevalent at the time. By considering historical examples, from an era
   when materials and processes were very different, the article
   demonstrates the active, physical effects of photographic enlargement,
   revealing print size to be not simply a changeable option but an
   inherently material condition, honing our understanding of why a
   photograph is big by demonstrating how it got that way.},

Number = {3},
Pages = {291-299},
Abstract = {It is well known that engravings were used by artists as models for
   their paintings. Another visual source employed by painters was the
   photograph. This occurred in Turkey after photography was introduced
   into Ottoman territories as a result of visits made by Europeans to the
   Ottoman states. In addition, courses on photography were added to the
   curricula of the schools. Although photography was initially received
   negatively by the public, the positive attitude of the Ottoman Sultans
   determined the popularity and acceptance of this branch of art. The
   introduction of photography and its adoption by the Istanbul public
   occurred first during the reign of Sultan Abdulmecid (1839-1861).
   Sultans Abdulaziz (1861-1876) and Abdulhamid II (1876-1909) played
   significant roles in the development of Ottoman photography. In
   addition, Abdulhamid II appointed photographers to document the events,
   institutions and structures in the empire and had around 800 photograph
   albums prepared. In these albums important settlements, structures and
   gardens of the period are documented. In wall paintings and in paintings
   on canvas, photographs were notably used as sources.},

Abstract = {The conventions of the photographed portrait have undergone significant
   changes within the period of its relatively short history. Some of these
   changes are linked to developments in painting, while others result from
   questions concerning the nature of the photographic medium. This essay
   examines the emergence in the early twentieth century of a new genre of
   portrait photography that reflects an increasing interest in human
   psychology and privileges the representation of emotional states over
   the depiction of faithful likeness. In addition to the three principal
   subjects of this essay, reference is made to painter-photographers of
   the late nineteenth century such as Edvard Munch, Alfons Mucha and
   August Strindberg, all of whom tested possibilities of the psychological
   portrait genre. Just how Witkiewicz, Trcka and Kesting broke the rules
   of conventional photographic portraiture is discussed by way of examples
   drawn from their photographic oeuvre.},

Abstract = {Eadweard Muybridge and Ottomar Anschutz are regarded as predecessors of

   impression of a moving image when set in motion. In both cases the
   series of images were mounted as loops on disks or drums similar to
   those used for optical toys throughout the nineteenth century. As the
   loop makes certain formal demands on the images used for it, the
   photographic series had to meet them. Yet, when the disks or drums with
   them were spun, the movement created would appear to be repetitive,
   colliding with notions of temporality and truth attributed to
   photography. Under these conditions the shift from photographic
   animation to cinematic film appears to be a break more than a smooth
   transition.},

Abstract = {The invention in the nineteenth century of stereoscopic photography and
   of indirect colour photography are re-examined so as to underline
   elemental theoretical similarities between the two processes. Both are
   illusions, reconstructing either the impression of depth or of natural
   colour via the deconstruction of human perception into multiple images.
   Because of their similar foundations, the separate pursuits of colour
   and three-dimensional representation come to influence each other, in
   the first half of the twentieth century, as new devices are developed to
   facilitate their practice. Comparison of the two types of photography on
   a technical level is relevant to analysis of the meaning of the
   photographic image in all its forms and, ill particular, to scrutiny of
   its `realism'.},

Abstract = {In the late 1880s and early 1890s, a small number of professors -
   including Charles Diehl, Louis Courajod and Henry Lemonnier - started
   projecting photographic reproductions in their art history classes in
   France. They were among the first to teach the subject in the country's
   universities. This newly accessible technology enabled artwork-based
   demonstrations in the classroom for large audiences, complementing and
   eventually replacing paper photographs, plaster casts and other methods
   of reproduction. From the mid-1890s, demand for slide projections in
   universities was reinforced by the popularity of educational slideshows
   in French culture. They would become omnipresent in art history
   departments by World War I. This article explores when and why the
   projected photograph was adopted by art historians in lecture halls, the
   ways in which individual professors employed and discussed slides, and
   how their respective institutions invested in this activity. I argue
   that for the educators who instituted slide projection, the practice was
   about grounding the young discipline's methodology in the analysis of
   empirical data. It gave concrete form to scientific enquiry and was
   attractive to students. Showing slides was thus a powerful practical and
   ideological tool in the establishment of art history as an academic
   discipline in France.},

Abstract = {This article discusses two eras of manipulated photography -that of
   trick photography before 1914 and that of photomontage of the 1930s. The
   former had a carnivalesque character, while the latter highlighted
   political satire. Although profusely discussed in its days, trick
   photography was largely anonymous. By contrast, the 1930s brought about
   distinct personalities such as John Heartfield or the Soviet cartoonist
   Boris Klinch as well as prominent theorists, including Karel Teige or
   Gunther Anders. Despite formal differences the article argues for a
   continuity of approaches: both periods represent steps that question
   photography as a medium that claims stable signification.},

Abstract = {The author's discovery of a set of inscribed photographs of the Bandits
   of La Jalancha', made in La Paz, Bolivia in 1871 and now in the
   collections of Harvard's Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology,
   has made possible the identification of the photographed gang's leader
   Salvador Chico' with the Afro-Aymara anti-hero known in contemporary
   folklore as El Zambo Salvito. On their photographic journeys out of
   Bolivia, Salvador and his men were transformed into anonymous Indian
   bandits' and became generic illustrations of ethnic Aymara types in the
   service of racialised evolutionary science. Back in La Paz, however, the
   photographs were forgotten but the legend of the infamous son of an
   African slave from Chicaloma, a coca-producing hacienda in the region of
   Yungas, grew in the public imagination. Whereas nineteenth-century
   racial discourse only recognised his indigeneity, twentieth- and
   twenty-first-century folklore and illustrations have instead emphasised
   his blackness. In tracing the split legacies of Salvador of Chicaloma,
   through exported photographs and the formation of local legends, this
   work reveals how identity was constructed, evacuated, and made anew.
   This fluidity of representation was made possible, in part, by the
   relative archival invisibility of afrodescendientes in Andean South
   America, whose lives and histories remain largely uninscribed.},

Abstract = {This article considers the daguerreotype and electricity as the key
   driving forces in the early histories of photography and photomechanical
   reproduction. Drawing on three examples - daguerreotype electrotypes,
   galvanically etched daguerreotypes and the etching process developed by
   Hippolyte Fizeau - the article aims to demonstrate how closely they were
   connected and how much interest they raised among scientists and
   photographers in the early 1840s, particularly in France, Britain and
   the German-speaking countries. The article shows in what ways the three
   processes were employed and who developed and used them, which
   institutions and learned societies were involved in their progress and
   which theoretical concepts and discussions they gave rise to. Although
   all three were only short-lived technologies and were largely forgotten
   by the end of the 1850s, they are more than mere curiosities, as they
   contribute significantly to our better understanding of the earliest
   histories of photography and photomechanical reproduction.},

Abstract = {This article examines the role of photography in the Year of Revolution
   and the place this topic holds in historiography. Unlike many historical
   disciplines which perceive 1848 as a turning point in the nineteenth
   century, the history of photography gives the impression that
   photographic production was not really affected by the upheavals which
   otherwise had a great impact on the whole of continental Europe.
   Collections and archives, however, contain large amounts of visual and
   written material that indicate the very opposite - that the involvement
   of photography in the events of 1848 was not rare. Using five examples
   from Central Europe, three portraits and two cityscapes, this article
   provides an insight into the cultural and historical backgrounds of
   photographic production in that year. The article demonstrates the ways
   in which photographs were involved in the social, political, and
   cultural events of the time, and how they helped shape ideas about them.},

Abstract = {This essay aims to examine the beginnings of photography in the Moravian
   capital of Brno, which, albeit for a short period between 1839 and 1842,
   was the gateway for the dissemination of photography to Moravia, Silesia
   and Bohemia. With the support of learned societies and other
   institutions in the region, local photographers were able to keep up
   with recent advances in daguerreotype processes. The most proficient
   among these enthusiasts was the Premonstratensian and Professor of
   Physics at the local Philosophy School, Friedrich Franz. Six
   daguerreotypes preserved in collections in Brno, as well as our
   knowledge of the social and institutional context of their origin,
   provide the foundation for this study of the beginnings of photography
   in Brno, and in Central Europe in general.},

Abstract = {In 1929, a group of editors affiliated with the Austrian Social
   Democratic Party (SDAP) established Der Kuckuck, a magazine modelled in
   content and format on mainstream boulevard weeklies, but directed
   specifically at a working-class public. Der Kuckuck was one of the few
   SDAP publications that attempted to collaborate with its audience,
   introducing within its first year a photography contest open to all
   readers. The photography contest became a signature feature of the
   magazine and was described by the editors as a means to cultivate
   `Arbeiterfotographie' or workers' photography, a term usually associated
   with the pioneering activities of the German communist magazines
   Arbeiter Illustrierte Zeitung and Arbeiterfotograf. This study explores
   the political and aesthetic contours of `Arbeiterfotographie' in an
   Austrian social democratic context.},

Year = {2014},
Volume = {38},
Number = {3},
Pages = {233-254},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Felix Nadar, a renowned caricaturist, portrait photographer, and
   aeronaut, took nearly one hundred albumen prints of the Paris catacombs
   and sewers by electric light in the early 1860s. More than a
   demonstration of technical innovation in bringing the mythic underground
   to light, this crucial archive constitutes a metaphorical mapping of the
   metabolism of the urban body during Haussmannisation. Nadar's work
   articulates the city's relation to its exclusions - decay and filth -
   and its struggle to cleanse and regulate human remains and wastes. He
   not only engaged with historical memory, sanitary reform, and scientific
   development, but also expanded the aesthetics of the sublime and the
   uncanny by experimenting with different states of perceptibility and the
   psychological force of shadows. In the context of topographical
   photography in the mid nineteenth century, the underground series
   presents Nadar's meaningful elaboration of photographic Romanticism and
   reveals his attitudes toward the urban transformation and tourist
   spectacle of Paris.},

Journal = {HISTORY OF PHOTOGRAPHY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {34},
Number = {3},
Pages = {300-313},
Abstract = {Based on Ara Guler's photographs of Istanbul, this paper explores the
   relationship between nostalgia and photography in the city. Most of
   Guler's best known photographs were taken in the 1950s and 1960s while
   he was working as a photojournalist for the print press. The re-coding
   of a selection of his black and white images since the 1990s as art
   photography and in the pursuit of recalling `Old Istanbul' as a
   cosmopolitan city presents a revealing case. Guler's recruitment as a
   photojournalist in the 1950s was a result of the expansion and
   modernisation of the city's print press, which itself was a response to
   dramatic transformations in the city, such as massive rural-to-urban
   migration and urban renewal and expansion. Guler's pictures from this
   era are typically of the urban poor and working classes. Focusing on two
   journalistic narratives co-produced by Guler - one in 1959 for the
   illustrated journal Hayat, and the other in 1969 for the daily Aksam -
   this paper asks why and how only images from the latter circulate today.
   It argues that contemporary urban discourses influence how we interpret
   these old photographs now.},

Pages = {255-264},
Abstract = {This article examines the evolution of atrocity photography and its
   links with humanitarian movements in the late nineteenth century. It
   argues that photographic images and the language of atrocity must be
   studied together in order to appreciate the relationship between them
   which was encapsulated in a genre depicting the ravaged or mutilated
   body. Three moments in the evolution of the relationship between

Abstract = {US feminist grassroots organising of the 1960s positioned its critique
   of domestic violence within a social analysis of class, race, sexuality
   and gender. In subsequent decades, feminist organising largely shifted
   to service provision which brought collusion with state entities and
   police in the quest to criminalise domestic violence. Criminalisation
   introduced a demand for corroborative evidence including the use of
   photographs to `prove' violence as enacted on victims' bodies. Through a
   consideration of the history of domestic violence photography and
   ethnographic data gathered with women residing in a domestic violence
   shelter, I explore how domestic violence photographs can reinforce
   entrenched gendered and racialised inequities and engender new ones. In
   many states, evidence-based prosecution does not rely on victim
   testimony and can be used without the consent of the harmed person.
   Rather than simply a mechanism of state control, however, the meaning
   and utility of evidentiary photographs remain unstable. Ethnographic
   data suggest that photographs and videos of domestic violence
   reverberate within and beyond the logics of state violence. I argue that
   photographic consent emerges as a vector to consider alternatives to
   criminal prosecution via policing.},

Abstract = {This contribution considers two ways of artistically approaching
   photography today. Comparing a selection of examples from the work of
   Allan Sekula with some of Jeff Wall's pictures, it looks at different
   methods to treat the relationship between the photograph and its
   caption(s). Furthermore, it investigates diverging attitudes towards the
   pictorial aspects of the medium. Also, whereas both artists are very
   much engaged in art critical writing, one can conclude that the
   interaction between their essays and photoworks is very much opposed.
   Finally, departing from the analysis of that selective body of images by
   both artists, which are addressing what can be named an `iconography of
   cleaning up', two diverging world views and modes of treating history
   are traced.},

Volume = {43},

Month = {JAN 2},
Abstract = {`What she captured is just gold', says Dallas Phillips. She is talking
   about the photographs taken by her mother, Mavis Phillips, nee Walley,
   one of Australia's earliest known Indigenous photographers. Representing
   an extremely rare perspective of life during protectionist and Native
   Welfare times from a Ballardong Noongar point of view, the Mavis Walley
   Collection (MWC) existed for decades as negatives kept in an old
   chocolate tin before coming to light at an oral histories workshop in
   Goomalling, Western Australia. By way of its knowledge-based digital
   archive, Storylines, the State Library of Western Australia worked with
   Mavis Phillips's family to restore and disseminate 325 of these
   negatives in 2015. This article argues that the MWC significantly
   differs from heritage photographs taken by non-Indigenous photographers
   in subject, composition, and style, expressing the joy and spontaneity
   of the photographer and her sitters. A product of intercultural
   collaboration between an Indigenous family and a non-Indigenous state
   institution, the MWC disrupts the pictorial record of Western Australian
   Indigenous history, shedding light on the rich past of a connected and
   thriving Ballardong Noongar family in Goomalling.},

Abstract = {The release of a film is commonly supported by the distribution of film
   stills expressly made for publicity purposes. This paper focuses upon
   this under-researched phenomenon. In particular, it suggests a typology
   of the publicity photograph, based on three parameters: setting,
   appearance and gaze. The findings are illustrated by discussions of
   publicity stills from Alien and from Aliens. The article finishes with a
   reflection on the practice of publicity photography and points to
   tensions between mimesis and contrivance within the publicity still.},

Abstract = {Lajos Kassak is best known outside of Hungary for his commitment to
   international dialogue among the avant-gardes of the late 1910s and
   early twenties, as exemplified by his periodical Today (Ma). Within
   Hungary, however, he is also recognized for his politically driven
   activities during the late twenties and early thirties, and
   specifically, for his role in organizing and promoting the leftist
   activities of the Work Circle (Munka Kor). The present essay challenges
   this traditional characterization of Kassak's career trajectory. A
   careful investigation of the paragon Work Circle project - the photobook
   From Our Lives (A Mi Eletunkbol) - demonstrates that Kassak's sustained
   interest and commitment are neither to purely aesthetic nor to purely
   political goals, but rather, to the very notion of art's aesthetic
   potential for political impact. Once we recognize that From Our Lives is
   a pedagogic project, we can properly understand its impact on the
   Hungarian worker photography movement: it was essentially an instruction
   manual for artists on how to construct a socially conscious image. As
   such, it should be distinguished from other more political works which
   did indeed serve as showcases for exemplary worker photographs - and
   even from the explicitly political messages presented in the eponymous
   exhibitions with which the Work Circle photobook is often mistakenly
   conflated. The broader applicability and implications for this sort of
   pedagogic analysis of a work's form and function are discussed.},

   close examination of the widely reproduced image The Kiss at the Hotel
   de Ville (1950) by Robert Doisneau. It considers to what extent this
   image can be constructed as a French photograph, located within a
   particular national paradigm of photographic humanism, suggesting that
   the image may be more appropriately accommodated in a historical rather
   than a national perspective, as its photographic signifiers allude to a
   technological past that may be as important an aspect of its continued
   popularity as its iconic depiction of a `typically French' motif.},

Abstract = {This article examines a photographic archive that has been recently
   identified in the stores of the Uganda Broadcasting Corporation in
   Kampala. The archive consists of some eighty-five thousand black and
   white negatives that were taken by various official photographic units,
   government information officers and commercial photographers - all of
   whom worked under the umbrella of the Ministry of Information - most of
   them during the years of President Idi Amin's rule (1971-79).
   Significantly, the vast majority of these negatives appear never to have
   been used to make prints. As a result, their images have been literally
   never seen before. The archive significantly extends our understanding
   of official photography in Uganda, and in postcolonial Africa. In
   particular, it shows how infrastructures of administrative photography
   that were established during the colonial era, and which resulted in the
   medium becoming central to an imagined `exhibitionary complex',
   continued to hold into the 1970s. The archive also highlights how these
   same infrastructures became increasingly complicated during the Amin
   years, both as the regime became more invested in photography as a
   potential tool for increasing the `momentum' of its development agenda
   and as it became more reliant on other forms of mass media as a means
   for projecting its - increasingly imaginary - forms of governance to
   Uganda and to the world. Finally, however, the fact that the majority of
   the negatives were never printed suggests that whatever were the
   intended effects of official photographs in Amin's Uganda, in practice,
   the performance of photographic techniques and archiving may have been
   equally politically significant.},

Abstract = {Stationed in cities, towns and villages across the Indian subcontinent,
   the colonial police were a ubiquitous presence under the British Raj.
   Visuality was central to the policing project; the police's
   effectiveness was predicated on colonial subjects' recognition of police
   authority. Photographs of policepersons and police buildings, appearing
   in manuals, histories and memoirs, private albums, imperial educational
   propaganda and on postcards, testify to the pervasiveness of the
   policing institution within the colonial landscape and the institution's
   commitment to visuality. The sheer volume of these photographs invites
   consideration. While existing scholarship on the colonial police and
   photography has largely focused on how the police harnessed the medium
   in their efforts to visualise colonial criminals, this article considers
   photography as a means of producing the police to make legible the
   imperial social order. Various photographs of policepersons and police
   buildings - mundane and propagandistic images when considered within the
   broader history of colonial Indian photography - index imperial
   interactions, revealing the visual language the police relied on to
   assert their authority.},

Abstract = {This study analyses the representation of women in the souvenir
   photographs of the Japanese-run studio of Kusakabe Kimbei. Contrary to
   readings that stress the studio's production of exotic images of
   Japanese femininity, this study focuses oil the local signifying systems
   that informed his photographic practice and work. The aim is to analyse
   Kimbei's photographs of Japanese women within the broader context of
   late-nineteenth-century visual practices in Japan, particularly with
   regard to popular images of geisha and courtesans that were available in
   advertising and other media. The present study considers the staging,
   photographing and marketing of Kimbei's photographs of Japanese women,
   three aspects of the trade crucial to the visualisation of women in
   Japanese visual culture. Through a consideration of these stages, this
   study aims to promote an alternative reading of the photographer's
   Souvenir photographs of Japanese women.},

Abstract = {In 1909, a series of photographs by Honolulu portraitist Caroline Gurrey
   was exhibited at the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition (AYPE) in Seattle.
   The photographs, which combine elements of the Pictorialist style and
   ethnographic photography, are portraits of young men and women of either
   Native Hawaiian or mixed-race heritage. The archival record indicates
   that the photographs were purchased in Honolulu by a member of the
   Exposition's administration, and Gurrey's original intention for them is
   currently unknown. Nevertheless, the author argues that through their
   display at the AYPE - an exposition that stressed industry, expansion
   and commerce as its key themes - Gurrey's portraits served a significant
   role in the articulation and visualisation of the Exposition's central
   goals and the United States's desires for settlement of the
   newly-acquired Territory of Hawaii by bourgeois white agriculturalists.},

Abstract = {Published in 1928, Andre Breton's Nadja is still an ambiguous,
   provocative book, not least for the way that text and photographs
   interrelate. There are several portraits in the book by two named
   photographers-Man Ray and Henri Manuel-and this paper initially examines
   the differing roles of their pictures. Next it turns to a glaring
   absence in the first edition: there is no photograph of Nadja herself.
   However, in the second edition, published in 1963, one was added: her
   eyes four times over. So, although there now exists an image of her, we
   may only see part of it. Nadja's apparent presence in the book is at the
   same time an absence, throwing into question Breton's own claims for its
   factuality.},

Abstract = {In the 1860s, the debate over whether photography was an accurate and
   useful tool for recording microscopic specimens was unresolved. Albert
   Moitessier's La photographie appliquee aux recherches micrographiques
   (1866) was one of the first instructional books to outline techniques
   combining photography and microscopy. Moitessier was unique among his
   contemporaries in his emphasis on stereoscopy and binocular vision. This
   essay addresses questions arising from Moitessier's unusual inclusion of
   a stereograph in his plates and his description of stereoscopic
   techniques in his text. While an ordinary photomicrograph renders the
   invisible microscopic world visible, the stereoscope brings this
   intangible realm within reach. The stereoscope is imbued, in this
   context, with a unique machinic vision as well as a haptic faculty that
   supersedes human perceptual ability. The apparent objectivity these
   extra-human capabilities facilitate, in turn, lends autonomy to
   stereo-photomicrographic tools. As the gulf between human and machine
   perception widens, the spectre of artificial intelligence grows,
   contributing to the disorientation in the nineteenth century over an
   expanded sense of existence.},

Abstract = {This paper explores a group of photographic portraits taken by the
   Jaipur maharaja Ram Singh II of female inhabitants of his zenana. These
   largely unexplored portraits of upper-class Rajput women who lived in
   purdah inhabit a peculiar intermediate zone between orientalist `harem'
   photography and Victorian studio portraiture, upsetting our expectations
   of both. In order to elucidate the unique character of these portraits,
   this paper sets them within the context of colonial and Rajput ideas
   about female roles in domestic space and norms of female representation.
   It argues that the portraits present the zenana as a sanitized and
   modernized domestic space and thereby defend this long-standing domestic
   institution from the critiques of late nineteenth-century social reform
   movements. Ultimately, Ram Singh's portraits of women in purdah are
   found to represent a staging of modernity in the service of tradition.},

Abstract = {From 1859 to 1878 the British sculptor Richard Cockle Lucas assembled at
   least sixteen albums containing photographs of himself in numerous
   guises, ranging from Shakespearean roles to embodiments of specific
   emotions. Lucas utilised the practice of dressing up in front of the
   camera in conjunction with the album format as an ongoing means of
   experimenting with photography's capacity to convey human expression,
   and as an extension of his concerns as a sculptor. Lucas's albums, which
   also include photographs of his work in sculpture, represent the first
   sustained pursuit of photographic self-depiction in such a wide range of
   roles. Read in conjunction with Lucas's own writings on expression in
   photography and sculpture, the albums reveal how Lucas viewed
   photographic self-portraiture as a form of living sculpture' to be
   enacted before the camera.},

Abstract = {This article examines the networks that form an archive using variations
   on a single photograph from the Thomas Rodger studio of St Andrews.
   Using the concept of a `thick thing', the article charts the
   trajectories of photographs of Bronze Age funerary urns as they left
   Rodger's studio, were collected in albums and used in lectures, and
   returned to the University of St Andrews Special Collections. Taking
   just one of Rodger's photographic assignments as a prism allows us to
   think about the circulation of many of his photographs both during his
   lifetime and after, as both the creation of `thick things' and as
   `material performances' that have since gained the title `Early Scottish
   Photography' in the St Andrews Special Collections. From a humble object
   photograph and its variations, the article argues for the agency of the
   photographs and their studio origins in forming the special collections'
   photographic collection, and making, in a very literal sense, the stuff
   from which we write history.},

Abstract = {What role should photographic evidence play in current debates about
   whether or not Britain should apologise for the historic crimes of
   empire? This article examines the photographs that emerged from the
   Amritsar Massacre of 13 April 1919, considering what such documents can
   tell us about the relationship between atrocity and the imperial
   project. Colonials working in both official and unofficial capacities
   turned to photography in their attempt to justify this bloody
   twentieth-century episode. Such photography addressed colonial debates
   concerning the scope of moral and legal, individual and collective, and
   British and Indian culpability for the Massacre. It is therefore
   important that we attend to such visual evidence at the Massacre's
   centenary, as the United Kingdom is urged to apologise for the infamous
   slaughter of Indian men, women, and children.},

Abstract = {This article looks at how aesthetic concerns inflected the dynamic of
   imperial relations during the 1857 Indian Uprising and its aftermath.
   The invention of photography inaugurated a period in which aesthetic
   imperatives increasingly came to structure the engagement of colonial
   bodies with the traumas of warfare in British India. The formal
   conventions of image-making practices were not consigned to a discreet
   virtual sphere; they were channelled into the contested terrains of the
   subcontinent through the poses that figures were striking for the
   camera. I trace how one pictorial convention - picturesque staffage -
   had the capacity to engender politically and psychologically disruptive
   tableaus on the contested terrains of empire, as colonial photographers
   arranged for Indian figures to pose on landscapes that were marked by
   disturbing wartime violence.},

Abstract = {Six camera obscura installations by New York-based artist Zoe Leonard,
   made between 2011 and 2014, offered spaces of imagination that were both
   primal and timely. These darkened rooms, with their wondrous projected
   images, did not `redefine photography' - an untenable claim that is all
   too readily made in the discourse of contemporary art. Rather than look
   at photography and its many technologies categorically, it would be
   better to assess the perceptions that individual photographic works
   afford on the technological situation of their time. Leonard's
   installations threw into relief the false interactivity and utter
   commodification of the self that dominate in today's e-culture -
   problems addressed in recent writing by Jonathan Crary as well. They
   heightened awareness of our fleeting human vision, leading to an
   intensity of thought and feeling without a portable or recorded image.
   With their invitation to contemplate reversibility at several levels -
   including, importantly, the switching between oneness and aloneness that
   stands at the heart of a living community - these works permitted a
   critical and poetic respite from conventions of our all-too-mobile
   moment.},

Abstract = {In a suite of approximately twenty abstract still lifes from the late
   1920s, Czech photographer Jaromir Funke boldly took shadow and mat board
   as his primary compositional elements. Amateur and avant-garde aesthetic
   stances balance in these self-reflexive works in a way that is
   paradigmatic for the era of high modernism in central European
   photography. Funke emulated here formal devices explored in Cubism and
   the photogram, whereby phenomenal reality is converted into a
   fragmentary sign system. In good amateur fashion, however, he refused to
   abandon mastery, to accept ready-made elements as in cubist collage, or
   cultivate chance as Man Ray did in his camera-less images. Indeed, in an
   article on Man Ray published near the start of this series, Funke
   suggested by implication his greatest ambition with Abstract Photo: to
   shape a history of the photographic medium and to indicate where that
   history is headed.},

Volume = {32},

Abstract = {Focusing closely on the incorporation of photographs into Stan Douglas's
   media installations, this essay argues that the relationship between
   photography and film in his work is more complex than critics have
   acknowledged. Drawing on Jacques Derrida's concept of the `supplement'
   as a necessary addition, both inside and outside specific forms, it
   contends that Douglas's use of photography is an integral part of his
   film works and installations and functions to foreground stillness as a
   theme. In doing so, the Cuba Photos undermine the seeming finality of
   still images and ironically reveal the end of faith in historical
   progress. While scholarship on circulation, following John Tagg's
   pioneering research, has emphasised Michel Foucault's concern with the
   historical construction of ideological meaning, the supplement in
   Douglas's work invites us to interrogate the very category of history by
   foregrounding the notion of re-construction. Approaching the
   relationship between photography and film in terms of the supplement
   offers a provocative way of understanding the significance of
   photographic circulation.},

Journal = {HISTORY OF PHOTOGRAPHY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {41},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {171-187},
Abstract = {Two examples of photographic montages from the first half of the
   twentieth century, one by the Modern Sketch Society in the magazine
   Shidai manhua and the other by the photographer Lang Jingshan, craft
   images of the modern Chinese nation. Although dramatically different,
   both images rely on assemblage formats and the photographic fragment in
   order to present a vision of a new China within a larger global context.
   This article proposes a nineteenth-century precursor to these
   photomontages in the form of an 1885 Shanghai magic lantern show as
   presented in the pages of the pictorial magazine Dianshizhai huabao.
   Originating as a lecture on world travel by the Chinese pastor and
   educator Yen Yung Kiung, the lecture was reconstituted into a
   lithographic series by the famous illustrator Wu Youru. Intended
   simultaneously as entertainment, as an educational and charity event,
   and as a series of lithographic and photographic images, the
   heterogeneous components of Yen and Wu's travelogue bring together a
   complex but coordinated vision of the nation. Like a photomontage in its
   constant juxtaposition of pictorial pieces, this transmedial `Tour round
   the world' strives to offer a particular view of China and its place in
   the modern world.},

Abstract = {Conceptualising an alternative to the Rieglian analyses of the
   correlation between power and composition in group portraiture, this
   article proposes a ritualistic approach to understanding the group
   photograph and its commemorative purpose. The proposal is raised through
   a case study of the photograph of Tohoro Duanfang (1861-1911) and an
   assembly of scholarly officials with the altar bronzes in his
   collection. Despite the uncertainty about its date and location, the
   photograph has been widely published in books on Chinese ancient bronzes
   and the culture of collecting. This article dates, decodes and
   contextualises this image within the imperial tradition of reinstating
   ancient bronzes in Confucius worship. It also discusses photography's
   primacy in the late Qing antiquarian praxis of studying, cataloguing and
   displaying bronzes. This study demonstrates that the process of taking a
   group photograph consists of a composite ritualistic event in which a
   `pro-photographic' event is imbricated with a `photographic event'. This
   imbricated flow of event and ritual may shed light on understandings of
   group photographs with an intelligibility that is not only visual, but
   also temporal.},

Abstract = {In response to scholars' recent preoccupation with the circulation of
   photographs, this article advocates greater attention to instances in
   which they have been withdrawn from circulation or reserved for future
   use. The focus here is on the most extreme of these closed collections,
   namely the time capsule, which was conceived in Philadelphia in 1876.
   The article shows how photography played a crucial role in the earliest
   time capsules - not just as their principal content, but also as a
   medium associated with fantasies of time travel, conceptions of
   posterity, and practices of storage. It then recovers the complex and
   contradictory political meanings of these photographic collections,
   thereby challenging the rhetoric of altruism and neutrality that has
   accompanied so many efforts to preserve photographs for future viewers
   and historians.},

Abstract = {For decades now, Douglas Crimp's landmark 1980 essay `The Photographic
   Activity of Postmodernism' has shaped our understanding of modernism's
   aftermath, at least as it unfolded in North America and Western Europe.
   Less remembered, however, is the degree to which the procedures of
   disjunction, copying, appropriation, and outright theft that he
   highlighted were epitomised not just by contemporary photography, but by
   photomontage in particular. This article recovers the debates that led
   critics such as Crimp, Abigail Solomon-Godeau, Christopher Phillips,
   Benjamin Buchloh and others to turn to photomontage as one of their
   principal objects of concern in what became known as the postmodern
   critique of photography. Why was montage tasked to perform this critical
   function, particularly by people around the journal October who had not
   otherwise devoted the balance of their writing to photography's history?
   The article suggests that these men and women, along with the
   contemporary artists they foregrounded, manifested what Mary Anne Doane
   has called a `desire for signification', a reaction in the late 1970s
   against the mute theatricality of minimalist and conceptual art.
   Photomontage reintroduced representation to contemporary art and to the
   canon of art history. But unlike the reemerging illusionism in painting
   that also manifested this desire, montage guarded against an
   uncomplicated realism by highlighting and critiquing operations of
   representation in a manner that painting no longer could.},

Abstract = {This article describes the institutionalisation of Brazilian photography
   in the late 1970s and early 1980s in the context of the other events
   relating to photography in Latin American countries. This process has
   close links with the first two Latin American Colloquia of Photography
   held in Mexico City in 1978 and 1981. These Colloquia promoted the
   creation of connections between Brazilian photographers and photographic
   institutions and those in Spanish-speaking Latin America. They also made
   it possible to bring European and North American institutional
   photographic experiences to Latin America, and helped to disseminate a
   version of Latin American photography in Europe, one that was based on a
   socially engaged documentary, the genre which was showcased and
   foregrounded at the Colloquia.},

Abstract = {Wisconsin Death Trip, the 1973 book by Michael Lesy, juxtaposes Charles
   van Schaick's nineteenth and early twentieth-century photographs of
   townspeople in Black River Falls, Wisconsin with local newspaper
   clippings of grisly murders and crimes. Drawing from police laboratory
   protocols, forensics manuals and case law, I show how Lesy's book
   imitates contemporaneously developed law enforcement techniques for
   presenting, justifying and interpreting photographs as evidence, which
   it uses to make a historical claim about death and madness in rural
   America. Ironically, the book's mimicry of these techniques creates its
   blind spot: Lesy is unable to see how Van Schaick's photographs actually
   relate to the indigenous Ho-Chunk people of the region and their
   struggle against forced removal by the US government. Studying Wisconsin
   Death Trip demonstrates how the interpretive momentum generated by a
   forensic approach to archival photographs too easily identifies the
   wrong crimes and perpetrators.},
